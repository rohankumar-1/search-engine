# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Cloud Deployment Configuration

When deploying the frontend to AWS, ensure the following steps are completed:

### API Endpoint Configuration

The frontend needs to connect to your deployed backend API. Update the `.env.production` file with the correct backend URL:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-actual-api-domain.com
```

For AWS deployments, this will typically be:
- CloudFront distribution domain for your backend API
- API Gateway endpoint URL
- Load balancer URL for your backend service

### CloudFront Configuration

If you're using CloudFront with S3, ensure the following:
1. CloudFront distribution has proper origin settings for your S3 bucket
2. CloudFront behavior settings include proper cache policy and forwarded headers
3. Error pages are configured to return `index.html` for 403/404 errors (required for SPA routing)

### CORS Configuration

If your frontend and backend are on different domains, ensure:
1. Backend API has proper CORS headers configured
2. API Gateway (if used) has CORS enabled for the frontend domain

### Environment Variables

Before building, ensure all required environment variables are set:
```
npm run build
```

This will create production-ready files in the `build/` directory that will be deployed to S3.
