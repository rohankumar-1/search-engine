        "headline": "U.S. protectionism could undermine modest growth forecast for eurozone, says EU Commission",
        "content": "FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Europe’s economy has left stagnation behind but is headed for only modest growth in coming months as consumers regain some of the purchasing power they lost to inflation, the European Union’s executive commission said Friday. The bloc’s economy remains at risk from protectionist moves by major trading partners, the report said. U.S. president-elect Donald Trump has often talked about imposing new tariffs, or import taxes, on foreign goods. “A possible protectionist turn in U.S. trade policy would be extremely harmful for both economies,” said European Economic Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni. The EU ”will engage with the new administration with a great spirit of cooperation” but also a willingness to defend open trade, he added. The 20 countries that use the euro are forecast to see growth 0.8% this year and 1.3% next year, the commission report said. AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports Europe and UK economies are not re-bounding quick enough, experts say. “After the stagnation in ’23, the European economy is growing again and is set to accelerate over the next two years, however growth remains modest and exposed to important downside risks,” said Gentiloni. Growth started to recover earlier this year as new wage agreements began partially restoring household finances. The commission said that “the restraint to consumption appears to be loosening.” It added: “As the purchasing power of wages gradually recovers and interest rates decline, consumption is set to expand further.”  Inflation is forecast to come in at 2.1% next year, just above the European Central Bank’s target of 2% and a substantial relief from the peak of 10.6% recorded in October 2022. Germany, the eurozone’s biggest economy is set for a second consecutive year of shrinking output this year at minus 0.1% percent, with a moderate rebound next year at 0.7%."

        "headline": "UK Treasury chief says she’s not satisfied by paltry third-quarter economic growth",
        "content": "LONDON (AP) — Britain’s Treasury chief Rachel Reeves said Friday that she is “not satisfied” by official figures showing the British economy’s rebound from recession slowed down sharply in the third quarter of the year, as the country’s top central banker voiced his concerns about the economic damage wrought by the U.K.'s departure from the European Union. The Office for National Statistics said growth during the July-to-September period was just 0.1%. That was lower than the 0.5% recorded in the previous three-month period and below market expectations of 0.2%. The statistics agency said overall output in September shrank, a development that has fueled accusations from critics of the new Labour government that its pessimism dragged the economy down in its first few weeks in office. The Conservatives’ Treasury spokesperson, Mel Stride said the deterioration in business and consumer confidence was a direct result of the government “talking the economy down.” On coming to power in July for the first time in 14 years, the government described its economic inheritance from the former Conservative administration as the bleakest in decades, requiring urgent action to fix the public finances. Reeves used the budget to raise taxes sharply, mainly on business, as well as increasing spending on public services, such as the state-run National Health Service, and borrowing for investment.  “Improving economic growth is at the heart of everything I am seeking to achieve, which is why I am not satisfied with these numbers,” Reeves said following Friday’s figures. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said raising economic growth his government’s number one priority over the next five years. Since the global financial crisis in 2008-9, the British economy has underperformed relative to previous years and actually slipped into a modest recession in 2023. The Resolution Foundation think tank said the British economy has been a “rollercoaster” over the past year and that its medium-term performance has been “staid and stagnant” As a result of the third-quarter slowdown, the think tank said the U.K. has fallen below the U.S. at the top of this year’s growth leaderboard of the Group of Seven leading industrial economies. “This all serves to highlight that the government’s mission to renew strong economic growth is both extremely hard, and absolutely necessary,” said Simon Pittaway, the think tank’s senior economist. One factor hobbling the economy, many economists say, is Brexit, when Britain left the EU in 2020, which has made trade more difficult. Though the post-Brexit trade agreement between the two sides ensured there would be no tariffs placed on goods, exporters are finding life tough. As part of Brexit, the U.K. also left the frictionless single market and the customs union, which means firms have to file forms and customs declarations for the first time in years, among other hurdles. On Thursday evening, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said he had to “point out the consequences” of Brexit, even though as an official he had no position on Brexit. “The changing trading relationship with the EU has weighed on the level of potential supply,” he said. “It underlines why we must be alert to and welcome opportunities to rebuild relations while respecting the decision of the British people.” Starmer has said he wants to “reset” the relationship with the EU but has ruled out the possibility of Britain rejoining the single market or the customs union, or of a return of the freedom of movement of people. However, ruling those options out doesn’t leave the British government much room for maneuver, Starmer has vowed to reduce some of the post-Brexit barriers to the movement of people and goods that have undermined ties between Britain and the bloc. This may see a new deal to limit veterinary checks on food at the border, an agreement on the mutual recognition of professional standards or the introduction of a program that would allow young EU and U.K. citizens to study, work and live for short periods in the U.K. and the EU, respectively. Most economists agree, though, that these changes would only modestly improve growth, which the government is counting on to improve Britain’s stretched public services."

        "headline": "Japan’s economy grows for a second straight quarter on the back of consumer spending",
        "content": "TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s economy eked out an annual rate of 0.9% growth in the July-September period as consumer spending held up, government data showed Friday. The world’s fourth-largest economy grew 0.2% in the fiscal second quarter, marking the second straight quarter of expansion, following 0.5% growth in April-June. Seasonally adjusted gross domestic product, or GDP, measures the value of a nation’s products and services. The annual rate shows how much the economy would have grown or contracted, if the quarterly rate continued for a year. Domestic demand grew at an annualized rate of 2.5%. Private consumption, which makes up more than half of Japan’s GDP, grew 3.6% on the back of healthy household consumption, according to preliminary Cabinet Office data. Recent data show wages and employment are improving. Spending was lower than the previous quarter, partly because of severe weather that crimped spending and shut down some factories. Recent income tax reductions helped boost spending. Exports grew 1.5%. The weakening yen is a plus for exports, tending to make Japanese products cheaper overseas. But the impact was relatively limited in the latest quarter. The Japanese yen was trading at 160-yen levels earlier this year. It’s now trading at 150-yen levels. Prior to the last two quarters, the economy contracted 0.6% in the January-March quarter after recording a 0.1% growth in October-December in 2023, highlighting how Japan’s economy recently slipped into periods of contraction in between weak expansion.  “We believe the Japanese economy will continue to grow gradually, supported by growth in overseas economies,” said Katsutoshi Inadome, senior strategist at SuMi Trust. He noted winter bonuses many Japanese get in coming months should also help strengthen domestic demand. As for headwinds, Japan is facing political uncertainty with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba having to survive a runoff this week to remain in office but now facing an emboldened opposition. Unlike the U.S. and other developed nations grappling with inflationary pressures, Japan struggled with years of deflation, or a continuous cascading down of prices that underlines a fragile economy. Inflation stood at 2.5% in September. Market watchers are also focused on when the central bank might move next on interest rates. The Bank of Japan kept interest rates at zero or below zero for years to wrest the economy out of deflation but is gradually raising them. Yuri Kageyama is on X: https://x.com/yurikageyama"

        "headline": "Singles’ Day shopping festival loses its shine under China’s lagging economy",
        "content": "HONG KONG (AP) — Businesses and consumers in China found the annual Singles’ Day shopping festival less attractive this year amid a sluggish economy, forcing e-commerce firms to look abroad for growth. Online service provider and e-commerce platform Alibaba started the now-famous event on Nov. 11, 2009, offering attractive discounts to entice shoppers to spend more. The extravaganza, also known as “Double 11,” has since expanded to other platforms in China — like JD.com and Pinduoduo — and abroad. It has long been regarded as a barometer of consumer sentiment. While Singles’ Day was previously a one-day event, shopping platforms in China now kickstart the festival weeks ahead to drum up sales volume. Even some brick-and-mortar stores join the festival by launching sales campaigns and hanging promotional banners and posters in the hopes of luring shoppers. But amid China’s lagging domestic economy, dragged down by a real estate crisis and deflationary pressures , consumers no longer go all out during the shopping extravaganza. Meanwhile, e-commerce platforms grappling with a slowing domestic market have turned to overseas markets to seek new growth, offering promotions like global free shipping and allowing merchants to sell worldwide with ease. Alibaba, for example, said in a blog post on its Alizila site that some 70,000 merchants saw sales double with global free shipping. In markets like Singapore and Hong Kong, new customers also doubled, the e-commerce company said.  Since the festival began in late October, “I have only spent a few hundred yuan on daily necessities,” said Wang Haihua, who owns a fitness center in the capital, Beijing. Wang said that the prices offered on e-commerce platforms during Singles’ Day are not necessarily cheaper than usual. “They’re all tricks and we’ve seen through it over the years,” she said. Zhang Jiewei, a 34-year-old who runs a barber shop in the city of Xi’an, echoed Wang’s sentiments, saying that he no longer trusts Singles’ Day promotions as some merchants tend to raise the usual prices before offering a discount, giving consumers the illusion they are getting a deal. “I used to buy a lot two or three years ago and I even purchased a mobile phone (during Singles’ Day),” he said. However, following the coronavirus pandemic, he stopped “because of lower income.” “I am not going to buy anything this year,” Zhang said. Some experts say that Beijing’s recent stimulus measures have had little impact on boosting consumer confidence. “People are not interested in spending and are cutting back on big-ticket items,” said Shaun Rein, founder and managing director of China Market Research Group in Shanghai. “Since October 2022, the weak economy means that everything has been on discount year-round, 11.11 is not going to bring in more discounts than the month before.” Rein said he expects low growth for the Singles’ Day shopping festival as consumers tighten their spending in anticipation of difficult economic times ahead. Categories such as sportswear and fitness, however, have been doing well as customers “trade down a Gucci bag for Lululemon sportswear,” he said. Jacob Cooke, CEO of e-commerce consultancy WPIC Marketing + Technologies, said that despite the luxury downturn, the shopping festival still showed strong sales for goods in premium price brands across categories like mother-baby, personal care and toys, as well as outdoor and sport. “There’s a clear shift in consumer priorities towards experiences, hobbies, and health,” Cooke said. “With record-level platform subsidies and generous membership programs like Alibaba’s 88VIP, consumers actually showed a preference for premium branded goods during this year’s festival.” Platforms like JD.com and Alibaba previously used to publish the total value of the festival’s transactions, but have stopped since 2022. While yearly growth used to be in the double digits, estimates of recent figures have dwindled to low single-digit growth. Syntun, a data provider, estimated that last year’s gross merchandising volume sales across major e-commerce platforms grew just 2% to 1.14 trillion yuan ($156.40 billion), a far cry from double-digit growth before COVID-19. Alibaba also owns popular e-commerce platforms Taobao and Tmall, Even some merchants who typically participated in the festival say the high cost of advertising no longer pays off as sales dwindle. Zhao Gao, who owns a garment factory in eastern Zhejiang province, said that after paying to advertise on e-commerce platforms, he would only break even after sales. “The platforms have so many rules for promotions and customers have become more skeptical,” he said. “As a merchant, I no longer participate in the Singles’ Day promotions.” Another merchant, Du Baonian who runs a food company processing mutton in Inner Mongolia, said consumers spend less and his overall sales were down by 15% compared to the past year. He still takes part in the Singles’ Day promotions but said the higher expenses do not typically generate returns because of slow sales. “We are seeing shrinking revenue, but advertisement on the platform can help us maintain our leading sales position,” he said, adding that he was considering advertising on more e-commerce platforms to target more consumers. Associated Press researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report."

        "headline": "Frustrated Americans await the economic changes they voted for with Trump",
        "content": "Follow AP’s coverage of the election and what happens next . WASHINGTON (AP) — Fed up with high prices and unimpressed with an economy that by just about any measure is a healthy one , Americans demanded change when they voted for president. They could get it. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to topple many of the Biden administration’s economic policies. Trump campaigned on promises to impose huge tariffs on foreign goods, slash taxes on individuals and businesses and deport millions of undocumented immigrants working in the United States. With their votes, tens of millions of Americans expressed their confidence that Trump can restore the low prices and economic stability they recall from his first term — at least until the COVID-19 recession of 2020 paralyzed the economy and then a powerful recovery sent inflation soaring. Inflation has since plummeted and is nearly back to normal. Yet Americans are frustrated over still-high prices . “His track record proved to be, on balance, positive, and people look back now and think: ‘Oh, OK. Let’s try that again,’ ” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former White House economic adviser, director of the Congressional Budget Office and now president of the conservative American Action Forum think tank. Since Election Day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has skyrocketed more than 1,700 points, largely on expectations that tax cuts and a broad loosening of regulations will accelerate economic growth and swell corporate profits. Maybe they will. Yet many economists warn that Trump’s plans are likely to worsen the inflation he’s vowed to eradicate, drive up the federal debt and eventually slow growth. The Peterson Institute for International Economics, a leading think tank, has estimated that Trump’s policies would slash the U.S. gross domestic product — the total output of goods and services — by between $1.5 trillion and $6.4 trillion through 2028. Peterson also estimated that Trump’s proposals would drive prices sharply higher within two years: Inflation, which would otherwise come in at 1.9% in 2026, would instead jump to between 6% and 9.3% if Trump’s policies were enacted in full. What to know about the 2024 election: News outlets globally count on the AP for accurate U.S. election results. Since 1848, the AP has been calling races up and down the ballot. Support us. Donate to the AP . Last month, 23 Nobel-winning economists signed a letter warning that a Trump administration “will lead to higher prices, larger deficits, and greater inequality.” “Among the most important determinants of economic success,” they wrote, “are the rule of law and economic and political certainty, and Trump threatens all of these.’’ Trump is inheriting an economy that, despite frustratingly high prices, looks fundamentally strong. Growth came in at a healthy 2.8% annual rate from July through September. Unemployment is 4.1% — quite low by historic standards. Among wealthy countries, only Spain will experience faster growth this year, according to the International Monetary Fund’s forecast. The United States is the economic “envy of the world,” the Economist magazine recently declared. The Federal Reserve is so confident that U.S. inflation is slowing toward its 2% target that it cut its benchmark rate in September and again this week. Consumers, though, still bear the scars of the inflationary surge. Prices on average are still 19% higher than they were before inflation began to accelerate in 2021. Grocery bills and rent hikes are still causing hardships, especially for lower-income households. Though inflation-adjusted hourly wages have risen for more than two years, they’re still below where they were before President Joe Biden took office. Voters took their frustration to the polls. According to AP VoteCast, a sweeping survey of more than 120,000 voters nationwide, 3 in 10 voters said their family was “falling behind’’ financially, up from 2 in 10 in 2020. About 9 in 10 voters were at least somewhat worried about the cost of groceries, 8 in 10 about the cost of healthcare, housing or gasoline. “I don’t think it’s either deep or complicated,’’ Holtz-Eakin said. “The real problem is the Biden-Harris team made people worse off, and they were very angry about it, and we saw the result.’’ The irony is that mainstream economists fear Trump’s remedies will make price levels worse, not better. The centerpiece of Trump’s economic agenda is taxing imports . It’s an approach that he asserts will shrink America’s trade deficits and force other countries to grant concessions to the United States. In his first term, he increased tariffs on Chinese goods, and he’s now promised much more of the same: Trump wants to raise tariffs on Chinese goods to 60% and impose a “universal’’ tax of 10% or 20% on all other imports. Trump insists that other countries pay tariffs. In fact, American companies pay them — and then typically pass along their higher costs to their customers via higher prices. Which is why taxing imports is normally inflationary . Worse, other countries usually retaliate with tariffs on American goods, thereby hurting U.S. exporters. Kimberly Clausing and Mary Lovely of the Peterson Institute have calculated that Trump’s proposed 60% tax on Chinese imports and his high-end 20% tariff on everything else would impose an after-tax loss on a typical American household of $2,600 annually. The economic damage would likely spread globally. Researchers at Capital Economics have calculated that a 10% U.S. tariff would hurt Mexico hardest. Germany and China would also suffer. All of that depends, of course, on whether he actually does what he said during the campaign. Trump has threatened to deport millions of undocumented immigrants , potentially undermining one of the factors that allowed the United States to tame inflation without falling into recession. The Congressional Budget Office reported that net immigration — arrivals minus departures — reached 3.3 million in 2023. Employers needed the new arrivals. After the economy rebounded from the pandemic recession, companies struggled to hire enough workers, especially because so many native-born baby boomers were retiring. Immigrants filled the gap. Over the past four years, 73% of those who entered the labor force were foreign born. Economists Wendy Edelberg and Tara Watson of the Brookings Institution’s Hamilton Project found that by raising the supply of workers, the influx of immigrants allowed the United States to generate jobs without overheating and accelerating inflation. The Peterson Institute calculates that the deportation of all 8.3 million immigrants believed to be working illegally in the United States would slash U.S. GDP by $5.1 trillion and raise inflation by 9.1 percentage points by 2028 Trump has proposed extending 2017 tax cuts for individuals that were set to expire after 2025 and restoring tax breaks for businesses that were being reduced. He’s also called for ending taxes on Social Security benefits, overtime pay and tips as well as further reducing the corporate income tax rate for U.S. manufacturers. The University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget Model estimates that Trump’s tax policies would i ncrease budget deficits by $5.8 trillion over 10 years. Even if the tax cuts generated enough growth to recoup some of the lost tax revenue, Penn Wharton calculated, deficits would still increase by more than $4.1 trillion from 2025 through 2034. The federal budget is already out of balance. An aging population has required increased spending on Social Security and Medicare. And past tax cuts have shrunk government revenue. Holtz-Eakin said he worries that Trump has little appetite for taking the steps — cuts to Social Security and Medicare, tax increases or some combination — needed to bring the federal budget meaningfully closer to balance. “It’s not going to happen,” Holtz-Eakin said."

        "headline": "Stock market today: Wall Street cruises to more records as it closes its best week in a year",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks cruised to more records as they closed their best week in a year on Friday. The S&P 500 rose 0.4% to cap its biggest weekly gain since early November 2023 and briefly crossed above the 6,000 level for the first time. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 259 points, or 0.6%, while the Nasdaq composite added 0.1%. The relatively quiet trading followed huge gains earlier in the week after Donald Trump won the presidential election and the Federal Reserve cut interest rates again to make things easier for the economy. Axon Enterprise, which sells Tasers and body cameras used by police officers, helped lead the market. It jumped 28.7% after delivering stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It also raised its revenue forecast for the full year to $2.07 billion, which would mean 32% growth. Expedia Group rose 3.8% after likewise topping profit expectations. It said booked room nights rose 9% from a year earlier. Helping to keep the market in check was Airbnb, which sank 8.7% after the online vacation rental platform posted a mixed third-quarter earnings report and issued forecasts for the fourth quarter that disappointed investors. Digital pinboard and shopping site Pinterest slid 14% after the company’s revenue guidance came in lower than investors expected, even as it easily beat Wall Street’s sales and profit targets.  All told, the S&P 500 rose 22.44 points to 5,995.54. The Dow gained 259.65 to 43,988.99, and the Nasdaq composite edged up 17.32 to 19,286.78. In the bond market, longer-term Treasury yields eased. A preliminary report in the morning suggested sentiment among U.S. consumers rose for a fourth straight month to its highest level in six months. The survey from the University of Michigan, which was conducted before Tuesday’s election, also said expectations for inflation in the coming year eased to the lowest level since 2020. The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 4.30% from 4.33% late Thursday. But it’s still well above where it was in mid-September, when it was close to 3.60%. Treasury yields climbed in large part because the U.S. economy has remained much more resilient than feared. The hope is that it can continue to stay solid as the Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates in order to keep the job market humming, now that it’s helped get inflation nearly down to its 2% target . Some of the rise in yields has also been because of Trump. He talks up tariffs and other policies that economists say could drive inflation and the U.S. government’s debt higher , along with the economy’s growth. Traders have already begun paring forecasts for how many cuts to rates the Fed will deliver next year because of that. While lower rates can boost the economy, they can also give inflation more fuel. In stock markets abroad, Trump’s talk about tariffs has raised worries about possible trade tensions and disruptions to the global economy. European indexes mostly sank to close out a losing week. Markets in Hong Kong and Shanghai fell as investors awaited much-anticipated steps by Beijing to rev up the slowing Chinese economy following a meeting of the legislature’s Standing Committee. Officials announced a 6 trillion yuan ($839 billion), three-year plan to help local governments refinance their many trillions of debt that has ballooned during the COVID-19 pandemic and a collapse of the property market. Financial markets worldwide have swung sharply as investors lay bets on what Trump’s plans for higher tariffs, lower tax rates and lighter regulation could mean for the global economy. But many professional investors have also urged caution, saying snaps back in prices could occur as it becomes more clear what proposals will become policy versus just starting points for negotiations. “Our experience is that such narrow reactions have not historically made for durable investment opportunities, and we favor pausing to look more closely at the likely main policy initiatives,” according to Paul Christopher, head of global investment strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. U.S. banks and the stocks of more domestically focused companies have seen some of the wildest moves, as some of the poster children of the “Trump trade.” The stock that’s become most synonymous with the president-elect, Trump Media & Technology Group , rose 15.2% Friday in its latest sharp swing to wipe out what had been a loss for the week.

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stock indexes edged lower Wednesday after drops for Eli Lilly and chip companies overshadowed a jump for Google’s parent company . The S&P 500 slipped 0.3% after drifting between small gains and losses several times, though it’s still near its all-time high set earlier this month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged down by 91 points, or 0.2%, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.6% from its own record set the day before . Alphabet climbed 2.8% after beating analysts’ forecasts for profit in the latest quarter, thanks largely to the performance of its Google business. It’s the latest of the highly influential group of stocks known as the “Magnificent Seven” to top high expectations for growth. They’ll need to, because critics say their prices have climbed too quickly, even if artificial-intelligence technology is creating a new boom. Computer chip companies have been some of the biggest winners of the AI rush, but Advanced Micro Devices helped drag down stocks across the industry after reporting profit for the latest quarter that only matched analysts’ expectations. It also gave a forecasted range for revenue for the end of 2024 whose midpoint was a bit below what analysts were estimating. AMD’s stock sank 10.6%. Nvidia, a chip giant that’s rocketed to become one of Wall Street’s largest most influential stocks, fell 1.4% and was one of the heaviest weights on the S&P 500.  One of the few stocks to hurt the index nearly as much was Eli Lilly, which sank 6.3% amid concerns about two of the drug maker’s blockbuster products: diabetes treatment Mounjaro and weight loss counterpart Zepbound. Eli Lilly reported weaker results for the latest quarter than analysts expected, as pharmaceutical wholesalers burned through inventories they had built up in previous quarters. Lilly cut its forecast for profit over the full year of 2024. Also falling was Trump Media & Technology Group, the company behind former Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform. It dropped 22.3% for the worst loss since taking its place on the Nasdaq stock market following a merger with another company in March. The stock is notoriously volatile, and it had been rallying strongly over the last month , up to $40 from roughly $12. Among the biggest movers on Wall Street, Reddit soared 42% after the company surprised investors and analysts and reported a profit . Super Micro Computer lost nearly a third of its value, 32.7%, after Ernst & Young resigned as its registered public accounting firm. A prominent investor, Hindenburg Research, published a report in August that accused the company of accounting red flags and other issues, which CEO Charles Liang later said contained false or inaccurate statements. All told, the S&P 500 fell 19.25 points to 5,813.67. The Dow dipped 91.51 to 42,141.54, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 104.82 to 18,607.93. In the bond market, yields edged higher following the latest readings on the U.S. economy. Growth for the overall economy slowed during the summer from the spring, according to a preliminary estimate by the U.S. government. But the performance was slightly better than economists expected. Recent hurricanes that struck the United States could lead to rebuilding that causes stronger growth in the fourth quarter but “the signal through the noise will likely be one of an economy that is still slowing, not reaccelerating,” according to Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. A separate report on Wednesday suggested employers outside the government accelerated their hiring this month, when economists were forecasting a slowdown. It could raise optimism for Friday’s more comprehensive jobs report coming from the U.S. government. Economists expect that to show the pace of hiring nearly halved in October. A slowing economy is no surprise after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates sharply in hopes of braking enough on the economy to get inflation under control. The question is whether the Fed can help keep the economy out of a recession, now that it’s begun cutting interest rates to keep the job market humming. A string of stronger-than-expected reports on the economy has raised such hopes, but it’s also forced investors to ratchet back expectations for how deeply the Fed will ultimately cut rates. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.28% from 4.26% late Tuesday and just 3.60% in the middle of last month. Traders are largely expecting the Fed to cut its federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point at its next meeting next week, according to data from CME Group. That would be a step down from its cut of half a percentage point last month, which kicked off the Fed’s rate-easing campaign. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mostly lower in Europe and Asia despite a 1% rise for Japan’s Nikkei 225 as the Bank of Japan began a two-day policy meeting.

        "headline": "US economy grew at a solid 2.8% pace last quarter on strength of consumer spending",
        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. economy grew at a healthy 2.8% annual rate from July through September, with consumers helping drive growth despite the weight of still-high interest rates. Wednesday’s report from the Commerce Department said the gross domestic product — the economy’s total output of goods and services — did slow slightly from its 3% growth rate in the April-June quarter. But the latest figures still reflect surprising durability just as Americans assess the state of the economy in the final stretch of the presidential race. Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity, accelerated to a 3.7% annual pace last quarter, up from 2.8% in the April-June period. Exports also contributed to the third quarter’s growth, increasing at an 8.9% rate. On the other hand, growth in business investment slowed sharply on a drop in investment in housing and in nonresidential buildings such as offices and warehouses. But spending on equipment surged. Wednesday’s report also contained some encouraging news on inflation. The Federal Reserve’s favored inflation gauge — called the personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE — rose at just a 1.5% annual pace last quarter, down from 2.5% in the second quarter and the lowest figure in more than four years. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PCE inflation was 2.2%, down from 2.8% in the April-June quarter. The report is the first of three estimates the government will make of GDP growth for the third quarter of the year. The U.S. economy has continued to expand in the face of the much higher borrowing rates the Fed imposed in 2022 and 2023 in its drive to curb the inflation that surged as the United States bounced back with unexpected strength from the brief but devastating COVID-19 recession of 2020. Despite widespread predictions that the economy would succumb to a recession, it has kept growing, with employers still hiring and consumers still spending. And with inflation steadily cooling, the Fed has begun to cut interest rates.  The report “sends a clear message that the economy is doing well, and inflation is moderating — good news for the Federal Reserve,’’ said Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. Within the GDP data, a category that measures the economy’s underlying strength rose at a solid 3.2% annual rate from July through September, up from 2.7% in the April-June quarter. This category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending. “Today’s GDP report shows how far we’ve come since I took office—from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression to the strongest economy in the world,’' President Joe Biden said. Other recent economic reports have also pointed to a still-healthy economy. In a sign that the nation’s households, whose purchases drive most of the economy, will continue spending, the Conference Board said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index posted its biggest monthly gain since March 2021. The proportion of consumers who expect a recession in the next 12 months dropped to its lowest point since the board first posed that question in July 2022. At the same time, the nation’s once-sizzling job market has lost some momentum. On Tuesday, the government reported that the number of job openings in the United States fell in September to its lowest level since January 2021 . And employers have added an average of 200,000 jobs a month so far this year — a healthy number but down from a record 604,000 in 2021 as the economy rebounded from the pandemic recession, 377,000 in 2022 and 251,000 in 2023. On Friday, the Labor Department is expected to report that the economy added 120,000 jobs in October. That gain, though, will probably have been significantly held down by the effects of Hurricanes Helene and Milton and by a strike at Boeing, the aviation giant, all of which temporarily knocked thousands of people off payrolls. Despite the continued progress on inflation, average prices still far exceed their pre-pandemic levels, which has exasperated many Americans and posed a challenge to Vice President Kamala Harris’ prospects in her race against former President Donald Trump. Most mainstream economists have suggested, though, that Trump’s policy proposals, unlike Harris’, would worsen inflation . At its most recent meeting last month, the Fed was satisfied enough with its progress against inflation — and concerned enough by the slowing job market — to slash its benchmark rate by a hefty half percentage point , its first and largest rate cut in more than four years. When it meets next week, the Fed is expected to announce another rate cut, this one by a more typical quarter-point. The central bank’s policymakers have also signaled that they expect to cut their key rate again at their final two meetings this year, in November and December. And they envision four more rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. The cumulative result of the Fed’s rate cuts, over time, will likely be lower borrowing rates for consumers and businesses."

        "headline": "IMF chief warns that world risks falling into slow-growth rut and urges China to enact reforms",
        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The world economy, buffeted by conflict and growing geopolitical rivalries , is in danger of getting stuck in a slow-growth, high-debt rut, the head of the International Monetary Fund warned Thursday. She also urged Chinese leaders to take more decisive action to jump-start their country’s sluggish economy or risk seeing economic growth plummet. “These are anxious times,’’ the fund’s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, told reporters during the fall meetings of the IMF and its sister agency, the World Bank. The IMF forecasts that the global economy will expand this year at what Georgieva called an “anemic’’ 3.2%. Global trade is lackluster at a time of conflict and growing geopolitical tension — including frosty relations the world’s two largest economies , the United States and China. ”Trade is no more a powerful engine of growth,’' she said. “We live in a more fragmented global economy.’ At the same time, many countries are struggling with debts they took on to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The IMF expects government debts worldwide to to top $100 trillion this year. That would equal to 93% of global economic output — a share that is expected to approach 100% by 2030. “The global economy is in danger of getting stuck on a low growth, high debt path,’' Georgieva said. ”That means lower income and fewer jobs.’' Still, the economic backdrop isn’t entirely bleak.  The IMF says the world has made considerable progress to rein in inflation that surged in 2021 and 2022 as economies roared back with unexpected strength from pandemic lockdowns. She credited higher interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve and other central banks and the easing of backlogs at factories, ports and freight yards that had caused shortages, delays and higher prices. In wealthy countries, the fund expects inflation to drop next year to the 2% sought by central banks. And price pressures have eased without sending the world into a recession. “For most of the world, a soft landing is in sight,’’ Georgieva said. But many people are still struggling with high prices and economic uncertainty. World leaders are telling her that their economies are relatively healthy — but ordinary “people are not feeling good about their economic prospects.’’ The IMF, a 190-nation lending organization, works to promote economic growth and financial stability and reduce global poverty. In its latest World Economic Outlook report, issued Tuesday, the fund forecast that the once high-flying Chinese economy would grow just 4.8% this year and 4.5% in 2025, down from 5.2% in 2023. Georgieva urged the Chinese government to shift away from dependence on exports and toward more reliance on spending by consumers, which she called a ”more reliable’’ engine of growth. Taking “decisive action’’ to reverse a collapse in the Chinese property market, she said, would boost consumers’ confidence and willingness to spend. “If China doesn’t move, potential growth can slow down to way below 4%,’' she said."

        "headline": "Yellen says isolationism ‘made America and the world worse off’ in speech to global finance leaders",
        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told world financial leaders Tuesday that the U.S. economy has grown stronger because the Biden administration rejected isolationism, offering a barely veiled criticism of former President Donald Trump’s policies two weeks before the U.S. election . Yellen opened the IMF and World Bank annual meetings by highlighting U.S. economic growth since the nation was in the grips of the COVID-19 pandemic. Without mentioning Trump by name, she said in a speech that the Biden administration had ended a period of international isolationism that “made America and the world worse off.” ”We went from millions having lost their jobs to a historic labor market recovery,” Yellen said. She said U.S. economic growth has been “almost twice as fast as most other advanced economies this year and last, even as inflation came down sooner.” The IMF released its international outlook on the global economy on Tuesday morning and upgraded its economic outlook for the United States this year while lowering its expectations for growth in Europe and China. The IMF expects the U.S. economy — the world’s largest — to expand 2.8% this year, down slightly from 2.9% in 2023 but an improvement on the 2.6% it had forecast for 2024 back in July. Growth in the United States has been led by strong consumer spending, fueled by healthy gains in inflation-adjusted wages. The meetings mark the last major international finance gathering held during the Biden administration and come as economic issues are a top concern for American voters. Republicans have blamed the Biden-Harris administration for inflation that reached a 40-year high before dropping. Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that the Biden-Harris administration “created an inflation crisis, record-high gas prices, skyrocketing mortgage and interest rates resulting in the lowest consumer and small business confidence in decades.” What to know about Trump’s second term: Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration. Voters remain largely divided over whether they prefer the Republican nominee, Trump, or Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris to handle key economic issues, according to an October survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research .  Who wins the U.S. election will also have enormous impacts on global finance and the world’s economy. Trump and Harris have spoken little about their plans for the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. But they have differing views on trade, tariffs and other economic issues. Trump has been skeptical of world financial bodies and is promising heavy tariffs if elected. Harris is more likely to continue the Biden administration approach favoring international cooperation over threats, though she has supported some tariffs. Yellen, like other federal officials, is barred from partisan political activity by the Hatch Act and chose her words carefully in her speech. But she praised Biden-Harris initiatives on climate, health care, infrastructure spending and other areas. She alluded to Trump’s international leadership saying: “From day one, we rejected isolationism that made America and the world worse off and pursued global economic leadership that supports economies around the world and brings significant benefits to the American people and the U.S. economy.” Trump, who has embraced isolationism and criticized multilateral institutions, promises as president to impose a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods and a “universal’’ tariff of 10% or 20% on everything else that enters the United States, insisting that the cost of taxing imported goods is absorbed by the foreign countries that produce those goods. Mainstream economists say that would amount to a tax on American consumers that would make the economy less efficient and send inflation surging in the United States. The Biden-Harris administration has not eliminated tariffs imposed on China during the Trump administration and in May also slapped major tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, advanced batteries, solar cells, steel, aluminum and medical equipment."

        "headline": "China’s economy grows at a 4.6% rate in the last quarter, falls short of the official 5% target",
        "content": "HONG KONG (AP) — China’s economy expanded at an annual rate of 4.6% in the July-September quarter, the government said Friday, in the latest evidence that recent efforts to rev up growth have yet to take hold. The world’s second largest economy slowed from 4.7% annual growth in the previous quarter and falling short of the official target of “about 5%” growth for 2024, a figure that some analysts consider ambitious without more aggressive measures to spur consumer demand and spur a recovery in the ailing property sector. In a statement, the National Bureau of Statistics said that the economy was “generally stable with steady progress” even in the face of a “complicated and severe external environment” and complicated domestic economic development. The economy has remained sluggish despite the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions at the end of 2022. Consumer confidence is low and the real estate market remains a drag on the economy. Chinese policymakers have in recent weeks announced a wave of measures aimed at boosting the economy, including reducing mortgage rates for existing homes and allowing banks to lend more by reducing reserve requirements. But Beijing has so far stopped short of unveiling major new stimulus plans that analysts and stock investors believe is needed to give the economy a major boost. China’s growth rate in the first three quarters of the year was 4.8%. On a quarterly basis, the economy expanded 0.9% in the quarter that ended in September, up from 0.7% growth in the previous quarter.  For the first three quarters, China’s factory output rose 5.8%, while retail sales expanded 3.3% compared to the same period last year. However, property investment sank 10.1% and the value of new home sales plunged 22.7%, underscoring weakness in the housing sector. Earlier this week, China reported its September exports slowed sharply, rising just 2.4% in dollar terms from a year earlier, down from 8.7% year-on-year growth in August. Imports were also weak, growing just 0.3% and missing estimates. “A boost from fiscal stimulus should help narrowly meet the annual growth target this year and support activity in the coming quarters, although this won’t stop growth from slowing again by the end of next year,” Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said in a report. Huang said that while retail sales and industrial output have improved, the housing market remains in the doldrums, with sales volumes still edging down and home prices continuing to drop. Real estate measures announced on Thursday, such as increasing financing for approved housing projects, are “unlikely to drive a significant turnaround in the sector and broader economic activity,” she said. Most of the moves by the government to revive the economy have been piecemeal. On Friday, China’s large state-run banks cut their deposit rates, to 0.1% from 0.15% for demand deposits and to 1.1% from 1.35% for longer term deposits. Meanwhile, the central bank issued guidelines for state banks to provide loans to companies and major shareholders for stock repurchases as part of an effort to stabilize China’s share markets, which have languished in recent years. The loans, which can be made only by 21 designated financial institutions, will have a maximum interest rate of 2.25%, the People’s Bank of China said in a statement that underscored plans for strict oversight of the effort to support the markets. The news helped drive a rally in Shanghai, with the Composite index up 2.1% and the benchmark for the smaller market in the southern city of Shenzhen up 2.4%. Shanghai’s benchmark has gained 9% in the past three months, though it had surged higher last month with the release of new measures to counter the slowdown, before falling back as investors registered their disappointment over a lack of big government spending initiatives. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index gained 1.9%."

        "content": "HONG KONG (AP) — China’s exports slowed sharply in September as global demand weakened, adding to worries over how to recharge growth in the world’s second-largest economy. Exports rose 2.4% in dollar terms from a year earlier last month, down from 8.7% year-on-year growth in August, the Chinese customs office reported Monday. Imports rose just 0.3% in September. Economists had estimated that exports would rise about 6% and that imports would climb about 0.9%. China recorded a trade surplus of $81.7 billion in September, down from $91 billion in August. China’s leaders have been struggling to rev up the economy since the COVID-19 pandemic ended. The U.S. and Europe recently raised tariffs on China’s exports of electric vehicles and other products, darkening the outlook for China’s trade as an engine of growth. The weak growth in imports reflects slack demand, partly due to a prolonged slump in the property industry, a major driver of sales of all sorts of products. Other data released Monday showed weakening in inflation and falling wholesale prices for manufacturers. Policymakers in Beijing have announced a slew of measures to boost the economy, including frontloading 200 billion yuan ($28.2 billion) from next year’s budget for spending and construction projects. Over the weekend, Finance Minister Lan Foan reiterated that the government is considering still more moves to drive faster growth. But Lan and other officials have not yet delivered stimulus on the scale economists say is needed to pull the economy out of its funk.  So far this year, up to the end of September, China’s exports have risen 4.3% year-on-year, helped by increased shipments of autos, which rose more than 20%, according to a report by ING Economics. But overall exports are slowing. “With this engine of growth stalling, other areas of the economy such as investment and consumption will need to step up to complete this year’s growth objectives,” the report said, referring to the government’s target of about 5% annual economic growth this year. If the government follows through on promises to increase spending, that could fuel stronger imports of various goods including industrial materials, Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said in a note. Earlier in the year, China’s export sector was the main factor supporting its manufacturers. “We think shipments will stay strong in the near term, supported by gains in export competitiveness,” said Zichun Huang of Capital Economics in a note. “Further ahead, though, growing trade barriers are likely to become an increasing constraint.”"

        "headline": "South Korea’s central bank cuts rates in a bid to boost the economy",
        "content": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s central bank on Friday cut its policy rate for the first time in more than four years as pressure to revive a sluggish economy outweighed concerns about the country’s level of household debt. The Bank of Korea lowered its key interest rate by a quarter percentage point to 3.25% following a meeting of its monetary policy committee, in its first move to lower borrowing costs since May 2020, when the economy was weathering the COVID-19 pandemic. The bank raised the rate by a quarter percentage point in August 2021 over concerns about inflation and soaring household debt, driven in part by skyrocketing house prices, and then froze rates for over three years. The bank said in a statement that domestic demand is making a slow recovery, bogging down the pace of economic growth. It said there was room for a rate cut because inflation is showing signs of stabilizing and household debt is also increasing more slowly as the housing market in the greater Seoul area cools down. At a news conference, central bank Governor Rhee Chang-yong said there’s still capacity in the economy for additional cuts, pointing out that house prices in the capital area grew by two thirds less in September than in August. The country’s consumer price inflation also eased to 1.6% in September, below the policy target of 2%. However, Rhee said it’s still too soon to conclude that the country’s financial situation is stabilizing and indicated that the bank would be conservative about further rate cuts.  “We will decide after monitoring the stability in financial markets,” said Lee. He said the bank’s latest step could be interpreted as a “hawkish cut,” meaning that it still favors tighter monetary conditions. Alarmed by slowing growth, government officials have called for the bank to lower borrowing costs. During a parliamentary hearing, South Korean finance minister Choi Sang-mok told lawmakers that he “respects and welcomes” the rate cut. South Korea’s trade-dependent economy is facing increasing uncertainties, including the growing crisis in the Middle East that could potentially influence fuel prices, exchange rates and public utility prices, the bank said. “The future path of economic growth is likely to be influenced by the pace of recovery in domestic demand, economic conditions in major countries and trends in information-technology exports,” the bank said. “The growth in house prices in the metropolitan area and household debt is expected to gradually slow down due to the strengthening of macroprudential policies,” aimed at maintaining the stability of the financial system, the bank said. “However, there’s still a need to monitor related risks, such as the impact the lowered base interest rate may have on household debt.” The bank projects South Korea’s economy to grow at 2.4% this year, down from 2.6% in 2023. Household loans issued by banks were measured at around 1,135.7 trillion won ($841 billion) at the end of September after growing by about 5.7% during the month, compared to a 9.2% increase in August. While the country’s exports have been gradually improving, job growth remains sluggish, due to weakness in construction industries and other sectors, the bank said. The headline of this story has been edited to reflect that the central bank cut, not raised, its policy interest rate."

        "headline": "Germany’s economy is on track to shrink for a second straight year",
        "content": "BERLIN (AP) — Germany’s government said Wednesday that its economy, Europe’s biggest, is on track to shrink for a second consecutive year — underlining the unpopular administration’s troubles as it heads into a difficult election year . The new forecast that gross domestic product will shrink by 0.2% this year compares with the government’s prediction in April of 0.3% growth and brings it into line with economists, who also have forecast a slight contraction. The German economy shrank by 0.3% in 2023. The government forecast growth of 1.1% next year and 1.6% in 2026. Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck, who is also the economy minister, said that the German economy hasn’t seen powerful growth since 2018 as the country’s structural problems have been joined by wider global challenges. “In the middle of the crises, Germany and Europe are squeezed between China and the U.S., and must learn to assert themselves,” he said in a statement. Habeck argued that the government has tackled many of Germany’s problems at home — securing its energy supply, speeding up planning procedures, trimming bureaucracy and trying to address a shortage of skilled workers. The German Chamber of Commerce and Industry said that such measures need to be implemented quickly and more reforms are required to encourage investment. Its chief executive, Martin Wansleben, said that Germany has only once before had two successive years of recession — in 2002 and 2003, when the government launched a series of welfare state reforms — and that GDP is only half a percentage point above its level before the COVID-19 pandemic.  “There has never yet been such a prolonged phase of weakness in the German economy,” he said. Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s three-party coalition government has seen its popularity plunge over nearly three years in office. It has become notorious for constant infighting, for instance over next year’s budget . The center-right opposition leads polls before a national election scheduled for September, and the far-right Alternative for Germany also has performed strongly in recent state and European Parliament elections. This version corrects the year for which 1.6% growth is forecast to 2026."

        "content": "HONG KONG (AP) — China’s economic planning agency outlined details of measures aimed at boosting the economy on Tuesday but refrained from major spending initiatives. The piecemeal nature of the plans announced Tuesday appeared to disappoint investors who were hoping for bolder moves, and Shanghai’s benchmark gave up a 10% initial gain as markets reopened after a weeklong holiday to trade just 3% higher. The head of the National Development and Reform Commission said the government will frontload 100 billion yuan ($14.1 billion) in spending from the government’s budget for 2025 in addition to another 100 billion yuan for construction projects. The scale of spending overall was well below the multi-trillion yuan levels that analysts said might be expected. The NDRC’s chairman, Zheng Shanjie, said China was still on track to attain its full-year economic growth target of around 5%. But he acknowledged the economy faces difficulties and an increasingly “more complex and extreme” global environment. China’s leaders have been struggling to rev up growth since the COVID-19 pandemic ended. A downturn in the property market has deepened that challenge, as consumer spending has lagged and global demand also has slowed. In a note, UBS chief China economist Tao Wang said that the market was “likely expecting a significant fiscal stimulus.” A modest package of 1.5 to 2 trillion yuan ($210 billion to $280 billion) is more reasonable to expect in the near-term, she said, with another 2 to 3 trillion yuan ($280 billion to $420 billion) in 2025.  In September, China unveiled a monetary stimulus package including cuts to mortgage rates and in the amount of reserves are required to keep on deposit with the central bank. Those and other measures were the most aggressive efforts so far to try to pull the property industry out of the doldrums and spur faster growth. On Tuesday, the NDRC said that new measures would focus on boosting investment and spending and supporting small and medium-sized businesses that operate at a disadvantage to large, state-corporations. But much of the information focused on technical issues such as payment regulations, management of projects and deployment of bonds for financing. To counter falling housing sales and home prices, Zheng said there would be “comprehensive policy measures to help stop the decline in the real estate market.” “In response to volatility and declines in the stock market, we will introduce a series of powerful and effective measures to strive to boost the capital market,” he said, without giving details."

        "headline": "US adds a robust 254,000 jobs and unemployment dips to 4.1% in sign of still-sturdy labor market",
        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — America’s employers added a surprisingly strong 254,000 jobs in September, easing concerns about a weakening labor market and suggesting that the pace of hiring is still solid enough to support a growing economy. Last month’s gain was far more than economists had expected, and it was up sharply from the 159,000 jobs that were added in August. And after rising for most of 2024, the unemployment rate dropped for a second straight month, from 4.2% in August to 4.1% in September, the Labor Department said Friday. The latest figures suggest that many companies are still confident enough to fill jobs despite the continued pressure of high interest rates. In an encouraging sign, the Labor Department also revised up its estimate of job growth in July and August by a combined 72,000. Including those revisions, September’s job gain — forecasters had predicted only around 140,000 — means that job growth has averaged a solid 186,000 over the past three months. In August, the three-month average was only 140,000. AP correspondent Jackie Quinn reports on analysts’ response to the strong September jobs report. “There’s still more momentum than we had given it credit for,” Stephen Stanley, chief economist at the banking company Santander, said of the job market. “I would call it solid — certainly not as explosive as what we were seeing last year or the year before, when we were catching up from the pandemic. But the pace of job growth overall is very healthy.’’ The September job gains were fairly broad-based, a good trend if it continues. Restaurants and bars added 69,000 jobs. Healthcare companies gained 45,000, government agencies 31,000, social assistance employers 27,000 and construction companies 25,000. A category that includes professional and business services added 17,000 after having lost jobs for three straight months.  Average hourly raises were solid, too. They rose by a higher-than-expected 0.4% from August, slightly less than the 0.5% gain the month before. Measured from a year earlier, hourly wages climbed 4% in September, up a tick from a 3.9% year-over-year gain in August. The economy’s progress in taming inflation led the Federal Reserve last month to cut its benchmark interest rate by a sizable half-point, its first rate cut in more than four years, and said further cuts were likely in the coming months. The Fed said it wanted to ease the cost of borrowing to help bolster the job market. In light of Friday’s strong jobs report, the Fed is now likely to reduce its key rate by more typical quarter-point increments. “The September jobs report shows a nice bump in labor demand at the beginning of the fall,″ said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank. ”The U.S. economy is growing solidly in 2024 even as inflation slows to near the Fed’s target.″ The resilience of the economy has come as a relief. Economists had long expected that the Fed’s aggressive campaign to subdue inflation — it jacked up interest rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023 — would cause a recession. It didn’t. The economy kept growing even in the face of ever-higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. Most economists say the Fed appears to have achieved the once-unlikely prospect of a “soft landing,” in which high interest rates help vanquish inflation without triggering a recession. The economy is weighing heavily on voters as the Nov. 5 presidential election nears. Many Americans are unimpressed by the job market’s durability and are still frustrated by high prices, which remain on average 19% above where they were in February 2021. That was when inflation began surging as the economy rebounded with unexpected speed and strength from the pandemic recession, causing severe shortages of goods and labor. The public’s discontent with inflation and the economy under President Joe Biden has been a political burden for Vice President Kamala Harris in her race for the White House against former President Donald Trump. The jobs report for October, which the government will issue four days before Election Day, will likely be muddied by the effects of Hurricane Helene and a strike by Boeing machinists. Across the economy, though, most indicators look solid. The U.S. economy, the world’s largest, grew at a vigorous 3% annual pace from April through June, boosted by consumer spending and business investment. A forecasting tool from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta points to slower but still healthy 2.5% annual growth in the just-ended July-September quarter. While most U.S. companies are still cautious about hiring, some say they’re struggling to find workers. At Overthrow Hospitality, which operates 11 vegan restaurants in New York, Drew Brady, the chief operating officer, has stopped requiring job applicants to have restaurant experience. Brady is seeking applicants who have a passion for food and a sense of the theatrical. His hourly staff now includes actors, students and foodies. It’s difficult, he said, to find experienced restaurant managers. His latest crop includes a former school principal and a server who had no management experience. “I can teach you how to manage a restaurant, but I can’t teach you how to care,” said Brady, whose restaurants employ between 100 and 150 workers. The new approach, he said, appears to be succeeding, and he plans to maintain it even if more experienced applicants become available. “The circumstances pushed us here,” Brady said. “But because of them, the light bulb went off. It’s a lesson in adaptation.” Given Friday’s robust hiring report, economists say the Fed will almost certainly cut its benchmark rate in November by a modest quarter-point, after its larger-than-usual half-point reduction in September. The healthier the job market appears, the less aggressive the Fed would need to be in easing borrowing costs. The policymakers would want to avoid easing credit so fast as to reignite inflation pressures. “The bottom does not appear to be falling out of the labor market,” said Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy at Glenmede. After Friday’s jobs report was released, Wall Street traders priced in a sharply higher likelihood of a quarter-point, rather than a half-point, rate cut at the Fed’s November meeting: 93%, up from 68% on Thursday. At Otis AI in New York, founder Miguel Guerrero said he’s optimistic that Fed rate cuts, which should lead to lower borrowing costs across the economy, will make it easier for startups like his to obtain financing to expand and hire. “There’s a lot more optimism in the startup ecosystem for getting more funding,’’ he said. Otis AI helps companies advertise online. After a round of tech industry layoffs last year, Guerrero said, “It’s easy for companies to find top-level talent right now.” Yet the availability of experienced tech workers can make it difficult for younger applicants to find work. For a startup, Guerrero said, “it doesn’t make sense to put an entry-level person in there. You’re not going to have time to bring them up to speed.’’ AP Retail Writer Anne D’Innocenzio in New York and Economics Writer Christopher Rugaber in Washington contributed to this report."

        "headline": "Stock market today: Dow rallies to a record after a blockbuster jobs report",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks rallied Friday after a surprisingly strong report on the U.S. job market raised optimism about the economy. The S&P 500 climbed 0.9% and got close to its all-time high set on Monday . The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 341 points, or 0.8%, to set its own record, while the Nasdaq composite clambered 1.2% higher. Leading the way were banks, airlines, cruise-ship operators and other companies whose profits can benefit the most from a stronger economy where people are working and better able to pay for things. Norwegian Cruise Line steamed 4.9% higher, JPMorgan Chase rose 3.5% and the small companies in the Russell 2000 index gained 1.5%. They helped stock indexes claw back losses from earlier in the week, caused by worries that worsening tensions in the Middle East could lead to disruptions in the global flow of oil. Crude prices rose again Friday, but the moves were more modest than earlier in the week, as the world continued its wait to see how Israel will respond to Iran’s missile attack . In the meantime, the strength of the U.S. economy reclaimed its spot as the top mover of markets. Treasury yields soared in the bond market after the U.S. government said employers added 254,000 more jobs to their payrolls last month than they cut. That was an acceleration from August’s hiring pace of 159,000 and blew past economists’ forecasts.  It was a “grand slam” of a report, according to Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector investing within Goldman Sachs Asset Management. She said policy makers at the Federal Reserve, who have been trying to pull off the difficult feat of keeping the economy humming while getting inflation under control, “must be smiling.” Friday’s report capped a week of mostly encouraging data on the economy, helping to allay one of Wall Street’s top questions: Can the job market continue to hold up after the Fed earlier kept interest rates at a two-decade high? Before Friday’s jobs report, the general trend had been a slowdown in hiring by U.S. employers. That’s not surprising given how hard the Fed pressed the brakes on the economy through higher rates in order to stamp out high inflation . But Friday’s blowout numbers bolstered hope that the U.S. economy will keep growing , particularly now that the Fed has begun cutting interest rates to give it more juice. The Fed last month lowered its main interest rate for the first time in more than four years and indicated more cuts will arrive through next year. Friday’s jobs report was so strong that it pushed traders to abandon bets that the Fed will deliver another larger-than-usual cut to interest rates at its next meeting. They’re now forecasting zero chance for a cut of half a percentage point, according to data from CME Group. Just a week ago, they were saying it was better than a coin flip’s chance. “This report tells the Fed that they still need to be careful as a strong labor market along with sticky housing/shelter data shows that it won’t be easy to engineer meaningfully lower inflation from here in the nearer term,” according to Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. At Bank of America, economist Aditya Bhave expects the Fed to stop cutting its target for the federal funds rate when it hits a range of 3% to 3.25%. That’s a quarter of a percentage point higher than the bottom that he was earlier forecasting. The federal funds rate is currently sitting in a range of 4.75% to 5%. Such diminished expectations for future cuts sent the yield on the two-year Treasury shooting up to 3.93% from 3.71% late Thursday. The 10-year yield jumped to 3.97% from 3.85%. The forced rethink about how low rates will ultimately go hurt stocks of home builders, real-estate owners and other companies that benefit from easier mortgage rates. D.R. Horton, PulteGroup and Lennar all sank at least 2.5% for three of the biggest losses in the S&P 500. Home Depot slipped 0.8% and was the biggest single reason the Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged other indexes. During the day, the Dow went from an early gain of 300 points to a modest loss and back to a big gain. All told, the S&P 500 rose 51.13 points to 5,751.07. The Dow gained 341.16 to 42,352.75, and the Nasdaq climbed 219.37 to 18,137.85. Also Friday, some 45,000 dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports returned to work after their union reached a deal to suspend its three-day strike until Jan. 15 to provide time to negotiate a new contract. That helped calm worries that a lengthy strike could have pushed up on inflation and dragged on the economy. In the oil market, the price for a barrel of Brent crude, the international standard, rose 0.6% to $78.05 per barrel to bring its gain for the week to 9.1%. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude rose 0.9% to $74.38, up from roughly $68 at the start of the week. In stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe following the strong jobs report from the world’s largest economy. In Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng jumped 2.8% in its latest sharp swerve. It soared a bit more than 10% over the week on excitement about a flurry of recent announcements from Beijing to prop up the world’s second-largest economy.

        "headline": "US economy grew at a solid 3% rate last quarter, government says in final estimate",
        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The American economy expanded at a healthy 3% annual pace from April through June, boosted by strong consumer spending and business investment, the government said Thursday, leaving its previous estimate unchanged. The Commerce Department reported that the nation’s gross domestic product — the nation’s total output of goods and services — picked up sharply in the second quarter from the tepid 1.6% annual rate in the first three months of the year.  Consumer spending, the primary driver of the economy, grew last quarter at a 2.8% pace, down slightly from the 2.9% rate the government had previously estimated. Business investment was also solid: It increased at a vigorous 8.3% annual pace last quarter, led by a 9.8% rise in investment in equipment. The third and final GDP estimate for the April-June quarter included figures showing that inflation continues to ease, to just above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. The central bank’s favored inflation gauge — the personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE — rose at a 2.5% annual rate last quarter, down from 3.4% in the first quarter of the year. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PCE inflation grew at a 2.8% pace, down from 3.7% from January through March. The U.S. economy, the world’s biggest, displayed remarkable resilience in the face of the 11 interest rate hikes the Fed carried out in 2022 and 2023 to fight the worst bout of inflation in four decades. Since peaking at 9.1% in mid-2022, annual inflation as measured by the consumer price index has tumbled to 2.5% . Despite the surge in borrowing rates, the economy kept growing and employers kept hiring. Still, the job market has shown signs of weakness in recent months. From June through August, America’s employers added an average of just 116,000 jobs a month, the lowest three-month average since mid-2020, when the COVID pandemic had paralyzed the economy. The unemployment rate has ticked up from a half-century low 3.4% last year to 4.2%, still relatively low.  Last week, responding to the steady drop in inflation and growing evidence of a more sluggish job market, the Fed cut its benchmark interest rate by an unusually large half-point. The rate cut, the Fed’s first in more than four years, reflected its new focus on shoring up the job market now that inflation has largely been tamed. “The economy is in pretty good shape,’’ Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, wrote in a commentary. “After a big rate cut in September and considerable further cuts expected by early 2025, interest-rate-sensitive sectors like housing, manufacturing, auto sales, and retailing of other big-ticket consumer goods should pick up over the next year. Lower rates will fuel a recovery of job growth and likely stabilize the unemployment rate around its current level in 2025.’’ Several barometers of the economy still look healthy. Americans last month increased their spending at retailers , for example, suggesting that consumers are still able and willing to spend more despite the cumulative impact of three years of excess inflation and high borrowing rates. The nation’s industrial production rebounded . The pace of single-family-home construction rose sharply from the pace a year earlier. And this month, consumer sentiment rose for a third straight month, according to preliminary figures from the University of Michigan . The brighter outlook was driven by “more favorable prices as perceived by consumers” for cars, appliances, furniture and other long-lasting goods. A category within GDP that measures the economy’s underlying strength rose at a solid 2.7% annual rate, though that was down from 2.9% in the first quarter. This category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending. Though the Fed now believes inflation is largely defeated, many Americans remain upset with still-high prices for groceries, gas, rent and other necessities. Former President Donald Trump blames the Biden-Harris administration for sparking an inflationary surge. Vice President Kamala Harris, in turn, has charged that Trump’s promise to slap tariffs on all imports would raise prices for consumers even further. On Thursday, the Commerce Department also issued revisions to previous GDP estimates. From 2018 through 2023, growth was mostly higher — an average annual rate of 2.3%, up from a previously reported 2.1% — largely because of upward revisions to consumer spending. The revisions showed that GDP grew 2.9% last year, up from the 2.5% previously reported. Thursday’s report was the government’s third and final estimate of GDP growth for the April-June quarter. It will release its initial estimate of July-September GDP growth on Oct. 30. A forecasting tool from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta projects that the economy will have expanded at a 2.9% annual pace from July through September. This story has been corrected to show that PCE inflation rose at a 3.4% annual rate in the first quarter, not 3%."

        "headline": "China redoubles first-aid for its economy with support for banks and workers",
        "content": "China is redoubling its first-aid for its economy, targeting banks, workers and poor families as the ruling Communist Party prepares to mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic. Unconfirmed reports Thursday by the South China Morning Post and Bloomberg said the government plans to spend about 1 trillion yuan ($142 billion) on recapitalizing six big state-owned banks. The reports citing unnamed people familiar with the situation follow this week’s statement by Li Yunze, head of the National Financial Regulatory Commission, that regulators would increase capital at six large banks. Defaults by real estate developers following a crackdown several years ago on excessive borrowing for property projects have weighed on the banking sector, prompting the latest bailout. Banks’ interest margins and profits have shrunk, so “it is necessary to coordinate various channels such as internal and external channels to replenish capital,” Li told reporters in Beijing. President Xi Jinping and other top leaders held a quarterly meeting on the economy on Thursday, state media said, and acknowledged “some new situation and problems” had emerged. They promised to focus on support for new college graduates, migrant workers, the unemployed, elderly and disabled. The capital increase for the banks and promises of other measures were a second flurry this week of stimulus for the world’s second-largest economy as it struggles to regain momentum after the COVID-19 pandemic. For a second time this week, financial markets rejoiced.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng jumped 4.2% and the Shanghai Composite index surged 3.6%. The smaller market, in Shenzhen, was up 4.2%. Markets elsewhere in Asia and in Europe also logged strong gains. The raft of new measures to pump up growth began Tuesday, when officials from the central bank and other government agencies held a news conference in Beijing announcing various measures to help revive China’s ailing property sector and prop up financial markets. Those measures included lower bank reserve requirements, reduced interest rates and smaller minimum down payments for some mortgages. The statement issued after the meeting Thursday of the ruling party’s powerful Politburo called for “additional policies” for new problems that have cropped up, Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a commentary. “However, it remains unclear if this will include the large-scale fiscal support needed to stabilize growth,” he said. China’s leaders appear determined to show they are taking action to restore confidence in the economy on the eve of the Oct. 1 National Day holiday, 75 years after the communists took power in 1949. The government also announced special “living allowances,” or cash handouts, for the poor ahead of National Day observances. A notice from the Civil Affairs Ministry did not say how much would be paid. Although subsidies to ordinary people are uncommon, the ruling Communist Party sometimes marks special occasions with payments to families in difficulty. “We must look at the current economic situation comprehensively, objectively and calmly, face up to difficulties, strengthen confidence, and effectively enhance the sense of responsibility and urgency to do a good job in economic work,” said the statement issued after the Politburo meeting."

        "headline": "Harris is making a ‘capitalist’ pitch to boost the economy as Trump pushes deeper into populism",
        "content": "PITTSBURGH (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday pledged to build an economy that is both pro-business and helps the middle class as she pushed back against Republican nominee Donald Trump ’s claims that she’s advancing “communist” ideas. The Democratic nominee said in remarks at the Economic Club of Pittsburgh in battleground Pennsylvania that she “would take good ideas from wherever they come” as she promised to double the number of people being trained in registered apprenticeships and outlined her support for more home ownership. “As president, I will be grounded in my fundamental values of fairness, dignity and opportunity,” Harris said. “And I promise you, I will be pragmatic in my approach.” Little more than a hour before her speech, Trump offered his own competing vision of the economy while visiting a furnituremaker in Mint Hill, North Carolina. He defended his idea for a special lower tax rate for U.S. manufacturers and pledged to impose tariffs high enough that there would be an “exodus” of auto factory jobs from Japan, Germany and South Korea. “I’m imposing tariffs on your competition from foreign countries, all these foreign countries that have ripped us off, which stole all of your businesses and all of your jobs years ago,” Trump said. The dueling speeches by the two candidates reflected how they’re honing their economic messages for voters in battleground states. Both are trying to counter criticism while laying out their best cases for a public that still worries about the economy’s health. Trump is focused on the idea of U.S. dominance over foreign competitors, while Harris is stressing the importance of supporting the middle class and entrepreneurs. What to know about Trump’s second term: Follow all of our coverage as Donald Trump assembles his second administration. Harris later sat down for an interview with MSNBC and reacted to Trump’s calls for tariffs, saying, “You don’t just throw around the idea of, just tariffs across the board.” She added of her opponent: “He’s just not serious about very many of these issues.”  In the interview, the vice president also renewed her calls for raising corporate tax rates, saying, “I’m not mad at anyone for achieving success, but everyone should pay their fair share.” Those remarks came after Harris’ speech focused on her broader philosophy and what she’s trying to achieve for the economy. That was in contrast to Trump’s, which was more freestyle, including insinuations about Iranian connection to the two assassination attempts against him. The former president said the corporate tax rate would drop from 21% to 15% for companies that make their products domestically if he were elected. The Republican nominee suggested that his support for broad tariffs as high as 20% have made him an international target. “This is why people in countries want to kill me,” he said. “They’re not happy with me.” The candidates are each emphasizing the economy at a time when polls show that it is one of the most important issues for voters as they consider who to support. A recent AP-NORC poll found that neither candidate has a decisive edge with the public on the issue. Both say their own approach will do more to ensure that the U.S. economy — and not China’s — leads the world in this century. Both are eager to embrace an image as a tax cutter and are accusing the other of backing massive tax hikes on the middle class. It’s a meaningful shift in messaging as inflation concerns have ebbed somewhat with the Federal Reserve cutting its benchmark interest rates last week. Harris rebutted Trump by saying that she is a capitalist who believes in an “active partnership between government and the private sector.” She said Trump has “no intention to grow our middle class — he’s only interested in making life better for himself and people like himself.” The Democratic nominee plans to provide $100 billion worth of tax breaks and other incentives to build up U.S. manufacturing and emerging technologies, according to a person familiar with her plans who provided details on the condition of anonymity. She has a forthcoming brochure to outline her vision for the economy. Elsewhere, billionaire Mark Cuban said business leaders like him are backing Harris because she has taken considered stances that companies can understand even when they have a different perspective. “I want a president that for business goes into details and has a policy team that understands all the ramifications of what’s been proposed,” Cuban said on a Tuesday call with reporters set up by the Harris campaign. The Harris campaign’s efforts to show business support have overlapped with Trump’s in offering a host of populist ideas . In addition to wanting no taxes on tips, Social Security or overtime pay, Trump wants to limit the interest rate on credit cards to 10% and set up low-tax zones on federal lands to lure employers. Trump also wants to ditch the cap on the deduction of state and local taxes that he put into the tax code in 2017 while president. Both candidates see an opportunity to trash the other’s tax ideas. Trump recently dubbed Harris the “tax queen.” She wants to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%, as well as tax the unrealized capital gains of people worth more than $100 million. She would use the revenue from that and other policies to sustain tax cuts for the middle class that are set to expire after 2025 as well as offer new tax breaks to parents and entrepreneurs. Many of her policies build on ideas initially proposed by President Joe Biden. Trump claims her tax hikes would ultimately trickle down to the middle class. “She’s coming for your money,” he told an audience on Monday. “She’s coming for your pensions, and she’s coming for your savings.” Harris has shown that two can play that game. She labeled his call for tariffs a “national sales tax,” as it could increase the cost of coffee, clothes, electronics, autos and almost anything that gets imported or depends on imported parts. Her campaign likes to cite an analysis that originated with Brendan Duke of the Center for American Progress that estimated a 20% universal tariff would cost a typical family almost $4,000 a year. For taxpayers in the middle-income range, that sum would effectively increase their total federal taxes by 50%, according to calculations based on Treasury Department data . Trump has long portrayed himself as someone who will slash regulations, but Harris said Wednesday that she would do likewise because “whether it’s a new housing development, a new factory or a new bridge, projects take too long to go from concept to reality.” “China is not moving slowly,” Harris said. She added that she would reform permitting and cut red tape because “patience may be a virtue, but not when it comes to job creation or America’s competitiveness.”"

        "headline": "Asian Development Bank raises growth forecast for region, but warns of risks from trade sanctions",
        "content": "Developing economies in Asia are forecast to grow at a 5.0% annual pace this year, helped by a strong U.S. economy and surging demand for computer chips that power artificial intelligence, the Asian Development Bank said in a report Wednesday. The forecast was revised upward slightly from the ADB’s April estimate of 4.9% growth. However, the regional lender warned of the potential threat of more protectionist measures, such as higher tariffs on exports from China, depending on the outcome of the U.S. presidential election. The report highlighted several positive trends, including a rebound in exports from Asia of computer chips and other advanced electronics this year due to rapid adoption of artificial intelligence. It also noted that energy and food prices are moderating, though inflation remains painfully high in countries such as Pakistan, Laos and Myanmar. The upturn in global demand for semiconductors and related electronics materials and components has helped drive stronger growth in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea, and to a lesser extent, the Philippines and Thailand, and that trend is expected to continue. The report cited data from World Semiconductor Trade Statistics projecting that spending on memory chips, vital for AI applications, will expand 77% this year. Other types of exports, especially autos from China and South Korea, also are growing quickly, it said.  The U.S. presidential election is a major source of uncertainty. “The election could result in higher blanket tariffs by the U.S. on all global imports, and a broad-based and steep increase in tariffs on all U.S. imports from the PRC (China),” the report said. “This would significantly escalate U.S.-PRC trade tensions, with potential negative spillovers to developing Asia through real and financial channels.” Former President Donald Trump has pledged to stop U.S. businesses from shipping jobs overseas and to take other countries’ jobs and factories away by relying heavily on sweeping tariffs . Vice President Kamala Harris has criticized Trump’s plan to impose large tariffs on most imported goods, which she says would severely raise the cost of goods. Asia’s developing economies are also vulnerable to other U.S. moves that might affect their currencies or the cost of borrowing on foreign loans, the report said. China’s ailing property market remains a key risk and the report kept its forecasts for growth for the world’s second-largest economy at 4.8% in 2024 and 4.5% next year. The ADB’s chief economist, Albert Park, welcomed a flurry of fresh measures announced Tuesday by Beijing to cut borrowing costs and encourage more home purchases. “It’s good to see. Certainly there’s room for monetary policy expansion,” he told reporters in a briefing before the report’s release. “Whether that will work remains to be seen.” Among other positive developments, the report noted that energy inflation has returned to levels seen before the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020. That alleviates pressures on some economies that depend heavily on imports of oil and other fuels, such as Sri Lanka, China and Japan. Food inflation is still slightly higher, but falling. Rice prices fell by 12% to $589 per metric ton in late August after hitting a 16-year peak of $669 per metric ton in late January, the report said. They are expected to fall further, as rice harvests are projected to hit record levels in the 2024-2025 growing year, and prices for wheat and maize also have declined. Crops are likely to benefit from the La Nina climate phenomenon, which could bring beneficial higher rainfall to some regions though it also could cause destructive flooding in others."

        "content": "TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s economy grew at an annual rate of 2.9%, slower than the earlier report for 3.1% growth, in the April-June period, boosted by better wages and spending, revised government data showed Monday. That shows clear risks remain, including U.S. economic growth, which greatly affects export-reliant Japan. Political uncertainty in Japan is another risk as the ruling party picks a new leader. About a dozen candidates are seeking to succeed Prime Minister Fumio Kishida as head of the Liberal Democratic Party. The winner of its Sept. 27 vote is a near-certainty to be the next prime minister since the party controls parliament. The world’s fourth-largest economy grew 0.7% in the fiscal first quarter, according to the Cabinet Office, rebounding from the contraction in the previous quarter. Seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product, or GDP, measures the value of a nation’s products and services. The annual rate shows how much the economy would have grown or contracted, if the quarterly rate continued for a year. Monday’s GDP data showed domestic demand grew a robust 3.0% from the previous quarter on the back of healthy household consumption and private sector investments, as well as government investments. Exports grew a booming 6.1%, even better than the earlier reading for 5.9% growth. Japan’s GDP shrank 0.6% in January-March on quarter, after eking out 0.1% growth in October-December last year. The weakening of Japan’s economic clout is a pressing concern for a nation, which the IMF projects will slide into fifth place, after the U.S., China, Germany and India in coming years at the current rate.

        "headline": "Stock market today: Wall Street falls sharply to close its worst week in nearly 18 months",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Another rout hit Wall Street Friday, with formerly high-flying technology stocks again taking the brunt, after a highly anticipated update on the U.S. job market came in weak enough to add to worries about the economy. The S&P 500 dropped 1.7% to close out its worst week since March 2023. Broadcom, Nvidia and other tech companies drove the market lower amid ongoing concerns that their prices soared too high in the boom around artificial intelligence, and they dragged the Nasdaq composite down by a market-leading 2.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 410 points, or 1%, after erasing a morning gain of 250 points. Sharp swings also hit the bond market, where Treasury yields tumbled, recovered and then fell again after the jobs report showed U.S. employers hired fewer workers in August than economists expected. It was billed as the most important jobs report of the year, and it showed a second straight month where hiring came in below forecasts. It also followed recent reports showing weakness in manufacturing and some other areas in the economy. Such a softening of the job market is actually just what the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, have been trying to get in order to stifle high inflation , “but only to a certain extent and the data is now testing Chair Powell’s stated limits,” said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Friday’s data raised questions about how much the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate by at its meeting later this month. The Fed is about to turn its focus more toward protecting the job market and preventing a recession after keeping the federal funds rate at a two-decade high for more than a year.  Cuts to interest rates can boost investment prices, but the worry on Wall Street is that the Fed may be moving too late. If a recession does hit, it would undercut corporate profits and erase the benefits from lower rates. “All is not well with the labor market,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “The Fed wanted the labor market to come into better balance, but any balancing act is unstable.” Still, the jobs report did include some encouraging data points. For one, the unemployment rate improved to 4.2% from 4.3% a month earlier. That was better than economists expected. And even if August’s hiring was weaker than forecast, it was still better than July’s pace. Christopher Waller, a member of the Fed’s board of governors, said in a speech after the jobs report’s release that “I believe we should be data dependent, but not overreact to any data point, including the latest data.” “While the labor market has clearly cooled, based on the evidence I see, I do not believe the economy is in a recession or necessarily headed for one soon,” he said. While Waller said he thinks a “series of reductions” to rates is appropriate given that a slowing job market now looks like the bigger threat for the economy than high inflation, he said the ultimate pace and depth of those cuts is still to be determined. All the uncertainty sent Treasury yields on a wild ride in the bond market as traders tried to handicap the Fed’s next moves. The two-year Treasury yield initially fell as low as 3.64% after the release of the jobs report, before quickly climbing back above 3.76%. It then dropped back to 3.66% following Waller’s comments, down from 3.74% late Thursday. Wells Fargo Investment Institute’s Wren said he was surprised by the size of markets’ swings. While data has clearly shown a slowdown in the economy, he’s still forecasting growth to continue, “and it’s not the end of the world.” He cautioned investors against panicking and selling their investments in knee-jerk reactions. Despite its dismal week, the S&P 500 remains just 4.6% below its all-time high set in July. It’s also still up 13.4% for 2024 so far, which counts as a good year. A big reason for Friday’s sharp drops was weakness for some big tech stocks that had been benefiting from the AI boom. Broadcom tumbled 10.4% despite reporting profit and revenue for the latest quarter that were above analysts’ forecasts, thanks in part to AI. The chip company said it expects to make $14 billion in revenue this quarter, which was slightly below analysts’ expectations of $14.11 billion, according to FactSet. Its stock sank 15.9% for the week. Other chip companies also fell Friday, including a 4.1% drop for Nvidia. After soaring earlier this year as its revenue surged on the AI frenzy, Nvidia’s stock has been shaky since mid-July as investors question whether they took it too high. Because of its massive size, Nvidia’s stock is one of the most influential on Wall Street, and it fell 13.9% over the week. That’s even though Nvidia has continued to top analysts’ expectations for growth. “Earnings growth is going to slow from an incredibly high rate to something slower,” Wren said about Big Tech, “but it’s not going to be terrible.” On the winning side of Wall Street was U.S. Steel, which rose 4.3% after the CEO of rival Cleveland Cliffs told MSNBC that his company would still be interested in acquiring U.S. Steel if the White House were to block its proposed sale to Japan’s Nippon Steel . All told, the S&P 500 fell 94.99 points to 5,408.42. The Dow dropped 410.34 to 40,345.41, and the Nasdaq composite lost 436.83 to 16,690.83.

        "headline": "Stock market today: Wall Street tumbles on worries about the economy, and Dow drops more than 600",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks tumbled Tuesday to their worst day since an early August sell-off, as a week full of updates on the economy got off to a discouragingly weak start. The S&P 500 sank 2.1% to give back a chunk of the gains from a three-week winning streak that had carried it to the cusp of its all-time high . The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 626 points, or 1.5%, from its own record set on Friday before Monday’s Labor Day holiday. The Nasdaq composite fell 3.3% as Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks led the way lower. Treasury yields also stumbled in the bond market after a report showed U.S. manufacturing shrank again in August, sputtering under the weight of high interest rates. Manufacturing has been contracting for most of the past two years, and its performance for August was worse than economists expected. “Demand remains subdued, as companies show an unwillingness to invest in capital and inventory due to current federal monetary policy and election uncertainty,” said Timothy Fiore, chair of the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing business survey committee. Stocks of oil and gas companies were some of the market’s biggest losers after the price of crude oil fell roughly 4% on concerns about how much fuel a fragile global economy will burn. A barrel of benchmark U.S. oil is almost back to $70 and down for the year after climbing above $85 in April. Exxon Mobil lost 2.1%, and ConocoPhillips dropped 3.5%.  Similar worries about a slowing U.S. economy and a possible recession had helped send stocks on a scary summertime swoon in early August. It briefly knocked the S&P 500 nearly 10% below its record set in July, but financial markets quickly rebounded on hopes that the Federal Reserve could pull off a perfect landing for the economy . The Fed appears set to lower interest rates later this month in hopes of easing conditions for the economy and avoiding a recession after earlier jacking its main interest rate to a two-decade high to beat high inflation. Other reports due later this week could show how much help the economy needs, including updates on the number of job openings U.S. employers were advertising at the end of July and how strong U.S. services businesses grew last month. The week’s highlight will likely arrive on Friday, when a report will show how many jobs U.S. employers created during August. The jobs report has once again become the main event for the stock market each month, taking over from updates on inflation, according to analysts at Bank of America. Many traders are anticipating the Fed will deliver a full percentage point of cuts to interest rates this year, which is a “recession-sized” amount, Gonzalo Asis and other economists and strategists wrote in a BofA Global Research report. The strength of this jobs report, or lack thereof, will likely determine the size of the Fed’s upcoming cut, according to Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle. If Friday’s data shows an improvement in hiring over July’s disappointing report, it could keep the Fed on course for a traditional-sized move of a quarter of a percentage point. But if Friday’s report is weaker, it could drive the Fed to deliver an outsized cut of half a percentage point from the federal funds rate’s current range of 5.25% to 5.50%, Mericle said. While cuts to rates are generally boons to investment prices, a recession could more than wipe out that benefit by dragging down corporate profits. On Wall Street, U.S. Steel fell 6.1% in its first trading after Vice President Kamala Harris said Monday that she opposed the company’s planned sale to Japan’s Nippon Steel. The Democratic presidential nominee’s comments, which echo President Joe Biden’s position, came after Nippon Steel Corp. said last week it would spend an additional $1.3 billion to upgrade facilities in Pennsylvania and Indiana, on top of a previous $1.4 billion commitment. Nippon Steel also reiterated that it expects the transaction to close by the end of this year, despite ongoing political and labor opposition. Nvidia was the heaviest weight by far on the S&P 500 after falling 9.5%. Its stock has been struggling even after the chip company topped high expectations for its latest profit report. The subdued performance could bolster criticism that Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks simply soared too high in Wall Street’s frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. All of the stocks that have come to be known as the “Magnificent Seven,” which accounted for the vast majority of the S&P 500’s return last year and early this year, fell at least 1.3%. Still, it wasn’t a complete washout on Wall Street. Nearly 30% of the stocks within the S&P 500 climbed, led by those that tend to benefit the most from lower interest rates. That includes dividend-paying stocks, as well as companies whose profits are less closely tied to the ebbs and flows of the economy, such as real-estate stocks and makers of everyday staples for consumers. All told, the S&P 500 fell 119.47 points to 5,528.93. The Dow dropped 626.15 to 40,936.93, and the Nasdaq composite sank 577.33 to 17,136.30. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 3.84% from 3.91% late Friday. That’s down from 4.70% in late April, a significant move for the bond market. In stock markets abroad, indexes were lower across much of Europe and Asia. Worries were also growing about the resilience of China’s economy, as recently disclosed data showed a mixed picture . Weak earnings reports from Chinese companies, including property developer and investor New World Development Co., added to the pessimism. AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed."

        "headline": "US economic growth for last quarter is revised up to a solid 3% annual rate",
        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. economy grew last quarter at a healthy 3% annual pace, fueled by strong consumer spending and business investment, the government said Thursday in an upgrade of its initial assessment. The Commerce Department had previously estimated that the nation’s gross domestic product — the total output of goods and services — expanded at a 2.8% rate from April through June. The second-quarter growth marked a sharp acceleration from a sluggish 1.4% growth rate in the first three months of 2024. Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity, rose at a 2.9% annual rate last quarter. That was up from 2.3% in the government’s initial estimate. Business investment expanded at a 7.5% rate, led by a 10.8% jump in investment in equipment. Thursday’s report reflected an economy that remains resilient despite the pressure of continued high interest rates. The state of the economy is weighing heavily on voters ahead of the November presidential election. Many Americans remain exasperated by high prices even though inflation has plummeted since peaking at a four-decade high in mid-2022. But measures of consumers’ spirits by the Conference Board and the University of Michigan have shown a recent uptick in confidence in the economy. “The GDP revisions show the U.S. economy was in good shape in mid-2024,’’ said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank. “Solid growth of consumer spending propelled the economy forward in the second quarter, and the increase of consumer confidence in July suggests it will propel growth in the second half of the year as well.’’  The latest GDP estimate for the April-June quarter included figures that showed that inflation continues to ease while remaining just above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. The central bank’s favored inflation gauge — the personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE — rose at a 2.5% annual rate last quarter, down from 3.4% in the first quarter of the year. And excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PCE inflation grew at a 2.7% pace, down from 3.2% from January through March. Both the PCE inflation numbers issued Thursday marked a slight improvement on the government’s first estimate. A GDP category that measures the economy’s underlying strength rose at a healthy 2.9% annual rate, up from 2.6% in the first quarter. This category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items such as exports, inventories and government spending. To fight spiking prices, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023, lifting it to a 23-year high and helping shrink annual inflation from a peak of 9.1% to 2.9% as of last month. The much higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses that resulted had been widely expected to cause a recession. Yet the economy has kept growing and employers have kept hiring. Now, with inflation hovering only slightly above the Fed’s 2% target level and likely slowing further, Chair Jerome Powell has essentially declared victory over inflation . As a result, the Fed is poised to start cutting its benchmark interest rate when it next meets in mid-September. A sustained period of lower Fed rates would be intended to achieve a “soft landing,” whereby the central bank manages to curb inflation, maintain a healthy job market and avoid triggering a recession. Lower rates for auto loans, mortgages and other forms of consumer borrowing would likely follow. The central bank has recently become more concerned about supporting the job market, which has been gradually weakening, than about continuing to fight inflation. The unemployment rate has risen for four straight months, to 4.3%, still low by historical standards. Job openings and the pace of hiring have also dropped, though they remain at relatively solid levels. Thursday’s report was the Commerce Department’s second estimate of GDP growth in the April-June quarter. It will issue its final estimate late next month."

        "headline": "US shoppers sharply boosted spending at retailers in July despite higher prices",
        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans stepped up their spending at retailers last month by the most in a year and a half, easing concerns that the economy might be weakening under the pressure of higher prices and elevated interest rates. The Commerce Department reported Thursday that retail sales jumped 1% from June to July, the biggest such increase since January 2023, after having declined slightly the previous month. Auto dealers, electronics and appliance stores and grocery stores all reported strong sales gains. The July retail sales data provided reassurance that the U.S. economy, while slowing under the pressure of high interest rates, remains resilient. It showed that America’s consumers, the primary driver of economic growth, are still willing to spend. The prospect of a still-growing economy is likely to be promoted by Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign, which is preparing to roll out policies Friday to ban “price gouging” on groceries. On Wednesday, her opponent, former President Donald Trump slammed the economic record of the Biden-Harris administration , though he wildly inflated cost increases on food and monthly mortgage payments. Other economic data released Thursday was also mostly positive, including a report on first-time applications for unemployment benefits. The figures show that businesses are mainly holding onto their workers and not increasing layoffs. With Americans spending more, economists at Morgan Stanley have boosted their forecast for growth in the July-September quarter to a 2.3% annual rate, from an earlier estimate of 2.1%. The economy expanded at a healthy 2.8% rate in the April-June quarter.  All told, the latest data is consistent with an economy that is headed toward a “soft landing,” in which the Federal Reserve raises interest rates enough to cool inflation but not so much as to cause a recession. “The ongoing resilience of consumer spending should ease recession fears and reduce the odds markets have placed on a larger (half-point) cut” at the Fed’s meeting in mid-September, said Michael Pearce, an economist at Oxford Economics. Instead, economists increasingly expect the Fed to begin cutting interest rates next month with a modest quarter-point reduction in its key rate, which affects many consumer and business loans. Adjusted for inflation, sales rose about 0.8% last month. And excluding gas station sales, which don’t reflect Americans’ appetite to spend, retail purchases also rose 1%. Consumers have been pummeled since the pandemic by high prices and elevated interest rates. Yet at the same time, average wages have also been rising, providing many households with the means to keep spending. Inflation-adjusted wages have increased slightly from a year ago. Upper-income households have also seen their wealth increase , with stock prices and home values having jumped in the past three years. Increases in wealth can encourage more spending. Auto sales jumped 3.6% last month, the largest increase since January 2023. It marked a rebound from the previous month, when a cyberattack involving many dealerships slowed sales. Sales at electronics and appliances stores surged 1.6%. And they rose 0.9% at hardware stores and garden centers. Restaurant sales were up 0.3%, a sign that Americans are still willing to spend on discretionary items, such as eating out. Financial markets had plunged earlier this month on fears surrounding the economy after the government reported that hiring was much weaker than expected in July and the unemployment rate rose for a fourth straight month. Yet since then, economic reports have shown that layoffs are still low and that activity and hiring in services industries remains solid. Americans are also still splurging on services, such as travel, entertainment, and health care, which are not included in Thursday’s retail sales report. Still, some economists worry that much of Americans’ spending now is being fueled by the increased use of credit cards. And the proportion of Americans who are falling behind on their credit card payments, while still relatively low, has been rising.  But cooling inflation may give households a needed boost. Consumer prices rose just 2.9% in July from a year earlier, the government said Wednesday. That was the smallest year-over-year inflation figure since March 2021. And core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, slipped for the fourth straight month. While Americans are still willing to spend, they are increasingly searching out bargains. On Thursday, Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, reported strong sales in the three months that ended July 31. More Americans appear to be shopping at lower-prices outlets like Walmart. The company also boosted its sales outlook for this year and said that it hasn’t seen any signs of weakness from the consumer. Other companies are also starting to offer lower prices to entice consumers, a trend that is helping slow inflation. McDonald’s said its global same-store sales fell for the first time in nearly four years in the second quarter. The company introduced a $5 meal deal at U.S. restaurants in June; most franchisees plan to extend that deal through August. Evan Louey-Dacus, who lives in New York City and works in corporate event planning, said that with many food prices persistently high, he has shifted his spending toward discount grocers. “When inflation really started hitting grocery prices hard,” said Louey-Dacus, 22, “my tastes just changed. Instead of getting lots of potatoes or vegetables, I started getting lots of rice. Instead of getting lots of eggs, I started getting deli meat or I started shopping more local.” Louey-Dacus has also been buying second-hand items at thrift stores and turning to open-box items, which have been previously owned. His latest purchase: A laptop in an open box at Best Buy that was discounted from around $750 to $600. Arie Kotler, CEO of Arko Corp., a convenience chain based in Richmond, Virginia, said he’s noticed that shoppers have cut back their spending on discretionary items like salty snacks and candy bars since May. He said he thinks people are struggling with high interest rates on credit cards, with many of them maxed out.

        "headline": "UK economy grows 0.6% between April and June as it recovers from recession",
        "content": "LONDON (AP) — Britain’s economy continued its recovery from recession at the end of last year, with its GDP increasing by 0.6% between April and June, official figures showed Thursday. The second-quarter growth in economic activity, as measured by gross domestic product, followed a 0.7% increase in the first quarter and was in line with economists’ predictions. It was a welcome boost for the U.K.'s new Labour government, which has pledged to rebuild Britain’s economy after years of sluggish growth. “The U.K. economy has now grown strongly for two quarters, following the weakness we saw in the second half of last year,” said Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the Office for National Statistics. Growth was led by the service sector, in particular in technology, scientific research and legal services, the figures showed. That partly offset some weaknesses in retail and lower output in the TV and film production industry, where the Screen Actors Guild strikes in the U.S. in 2023 are still affecting U.K. production schedules. The U.K. economy fell into recession at the end of 2023 as GDP contracted by 0.3% in the final three months last year. Figures at the time showed that all three main sectors — services, industrial production and construction — were down. Rachel Reeves , Britain’s new Treasury chief, pledged last month to prioritize stimulating economic growth and reversing what she called “14 years of chaos and economic instability” under previous Conservative governments.  Some economists warned that growth could slow in coming months. GDP growth in the month of June was flat, with the service industry contracting by 0.1%. Others, including Peter Arnold, chief economist at Ernst and Young U.K., were more optimistic. “EY expects the economy to continue growing at a decent pace, though it will struggle to sustain the above-trend rates seen in H1 (the first half of) 2024,” he said."

        "headline": "Japan’s economy grew last quarter on healthy consumer spending and business investment",
        "content": "TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s economy grew at an annual rate of 3.1% in the April-June period, rebounding from the contraction in the previous quarter, government data showed Thursday. The world’s fourth largest economy grew 0.8% in the fiscal first quarter, according to the Cabinet Office. Seasonally adjusted gross domestic product, or GDP, measures the value of a nation’s products and services. The annual rate shows how much the economy would have grown or contracted, if the quarterly rate had continued for a year. Domestic demand grew a robust 3.5% from the previous quarter on the back of healthy household consumption and private sector investments, as well as government investments. Exports grew a booming 5.9%. Japan’s GDP shrank 0.6% in January-March on quarter, after eking out 0.1% growth in October-December last year. Economic growth went back and forth between such periods of contraction and weak expansion for the past year. “Today’s GDP data signal that the virtuous cycle between income and spending has become more pronounced but uncertainty surrounding macro policies has heightened,” said Robert Carnell, regional head of research Asia-Pacific at ING Economics. Carnell was pointing to the announcement Wednesday by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida that he won’t seek reelection as head of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Whoever replaces him as the party leader in the September vote will become prime minister since the party controls parliament.  “There is no strong contender to take over Kishida’s role, making it difficult to estimate the policy direction of the next government,” Carnell said. The Liberal Democrats have governed Japan almost the entire postwar period and are credited with guiding the nation’s rise as an economic power. But voters are increasingly worried about Japan’s declining clout. Japan is not facing the inflationary pressures seen in parts of the U.S. and other developed nations. Price rises have stood lately at about 3% for Japan, which underwent years of deflation, or a continuous cascading down of prices that underlines a fragile economy. The Bank of Japan, which kept interest rates at zero or below zero for years, has finally begun to raise rates. Some analysts say the move is part of the various factors behind the recent wild gyrations in global stock markets. The fluctuations have somewhat quieted in recent sessions. “We now think the Bank of Japan will take a more cautious approach to interest rate hikes due to the recent market turbulence following the last meeting, which saw a sharp unwinding of the carry trade,” said a report from BMI, a unit of Fitch Solutions.

        "headline": "Wall Street ends a wild and scary week almost exactly where it began. More tests loom next week",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — After a manic week that began with Japanese stocks falling to their worst loss since 1987’s Black Monday , only for U.S. stocks to soar later to their best day since 2022 , slight gains on Friday carried Wall Street almost exactly back to where it began the week. The S&P 500 rose 0.5% to shave what had been a brutal loss for the week down to a barely registerable 0.04%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 51 points, or 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.5%. The gains pulled the S&P 500 back within 5.7% of its all-time high set last month, after it had sunk nearly 10% below that record during the week. It was a vicious return of volatility for a market that had been rising smoothly, and a measure of fear on Wall Street briefly surged toward its highest level since the 2020 COVID crash. It also may not be over. Worries are still high about the strength of the U.S. economy, and reports are due next week on inflation, sales at retailers and other measures of strength. But on Friday, at least, the mood was one of calm after more big U.S. companies joined the pile reporting better profit for the spring than analysts expected. An up-and-down week on Wall Street is coming to a close. The AP’s Seth Sutel reports. Expedia Group jumped 10.2% after delivering stronger results than forecast, though it saw a softening of demand in July like some other companies. Take-Two Interactive rose 4.4% after the company behind the Grand Theft Auto and NBA 2K video games likewise reported better results than expected.  Earlier in the day, indexes rose for many other stock markets worldwide. They’ve also been frenetic since last week because of a number of factors slamming together at once. At the forefront is the value of the Japanese yen, whose sudden and sharp strengthening recently forced hedge funds and other traders to scramble out of a popular trade en masse. They had been borrowing Japanese yen at very low cost and then investing it elsewhere around the world. But a hike to interest rates by the Bank of Japan forced many to abandon the trade at the same time and sent global markets reeling. A promise by a top Bank of Japan official in the middle of the week not to raise rates further as long as markets are “unstable” helped stabilize the yen. Also weighing on the market have been worries about the slowing U.S. economy . A raft of weaker-than-expected reports forced questions about whether the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates at too high of an economy-crunching level for too long in order to beat inflation . A report last Friday showing much weaker hiring by U.S. employers than expected was the lowlight. Such worries dragged Treasury yields lower in the bond market, and they fell again Friday. Yields sank as investors looked for safer places for their money and as expectations built for deeper cuts to rates coming from the Fed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 3.94% from 3.99% late Thursday. After seemingly getting the Bank of Japan to stop hiking rates for now, Wall Street’s goal “now appears to be bossing the Fed into big rate cuts,” Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett said in a BofA Global Research report. Reports next week could drive more swings for the market. On Thursday will come an update on how much shoppers are spending at U.S. retailers. Households at the lower end of the income spectrum have been struggling for a while to keep up with still-rising prices, but economists expect the report to show a return to growth after a stall in retail spending during June. Another report on Thursday will show how many U.S. workers are applying for unemployment benefits. The most recent such report raised hopes for the economy after the prior week’s frightened investors. Looming over them all will be the latest updates on inflation. A worst-case scenario would be if Tuesday’s and Wednesday’s inflation reports show higher-than-expected rises in prices at the wholesale and consumer levels, while the week’s other reports show a sharp weakening of the economy. The Federal Reserve wouldn’t have an easy way to fix such a toxic mess. The central bank could lower interest rates, which would give the U.S. economy an upward push but also threaten to worsen inflation. Or it could continue to keep its main interest rate at a two-decade high. That would put downward pressure on inflation but also inflict more pain on the economy. To be sure, even though the U.S. economy is slowing, it is not in a recession. And many economists still see one as unlikely. A third factor that sent markets spinning recently is increased skepticism about Wall Street’s rush into artificial-intelligence technology, and how much profit growth it will really produce. The frenzy around AI allowed a handful of Big Tech stocks to drive the S&P 500 to dozens of all-time highs this year, even as high rates weighed on other areas of the market. But the group of stocks known as the “Magnificent Seven” lost momentum last month amid criticism investors got carried away and took their prices too high. All of the Magnificent Seven rose Friday except for Nvidia, which slipped 0.2%. All told, the S&P 500 rose 24.85 points to 5,344.16. The Dow gained 51.05 to 39,497.54, and the Nasdaq climbed 85.28 to 16,745.30. AP Business Writer Matt Ott contributed."

        "headline": "Saudi Arabia’s Aramco reports lower half-year profits as economic worries dampen energy prices",
        "content": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Saudi oil giant Aramco reported half-year profits Tuesday of $56.3 billion, down from the year before amid worries about a slowing global economy. Aramco, formally known as the Saudi Arabian Oil Co., said its overall revenue for the half-year was $220.7 billion, up from $218.6 billion the year before. Profits in 2023 were $61.9 billion, nearly $5 billion higher. Despite the turmoil in the global economy, Aramco remains bullish on the future with a projected increase in demand from the aviation industry and from China. “Growth in global oil demand is strong, reaching a record 103.2 million barrels a day in the first half of 2024, despite some headwinds,” Aramco CEO and President Amin H. Nasser told analysts on a conference call. “We expect further demand growth in the second half of the year.” Aramco will pay dividends of $20.3 billion for the second quarter and a performance-linked dividend of $10.8 billion, the company said. It hopes its overall dividend for the year will be over $124 billion. While a sliver of Aramco trades on the Tadawul, the vast majority of the firm is held by Saudi Arabia’s government, fueling its expenditure and providing wealth to its Al Saud royal family. Saudi Arabia, a leader in the OPEC cartel, has allied with Russia and others outside of the group to try to keep production down to boost global oil prices. Benchmark Brent crude traded around $77 a barrel on Tuesday after Japan’s Nikkei stock market plunged 12.4% Monday in its worst single-day decline since 1987.  It marked the latest in a global sell-off that began the previous week. A report Friday showed U.S. employers slowed their hiring in July by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the United States economy to come in weaker than expected . It’s all raised fear the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the U.S. economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation . The Nikkei bounced back Tuesday morning , nearly recouping those losses. Crude oil prices collapsed in the pandemic but rose again in 2022 on the back of Russia’s war on Ukraine, going as high as nearly $140. That sparked tension between the Biden administration and Saudi Arabia , but prices have since come down to a six-month low over concerns over the wider global economy. That’s made the price at the pump less of an issue ahead of the November election between former U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. Aramco produced over 12 million barrels of oil a day throughout the year, but maintains the ability to bring an additional 3 million barrels a day onto the market if needed, said Ziad al-Murshed, Aramco’s chief financial officer. It sold oil at around $85.70 a barrel in the second quarter, up from $83 in the first quarter. “Given this consistent growth in oil demand, combined with global inventories that are at the lower end of their five-year range, Aramco is well positioned going forward,” al-Murshed said. Aramco has a market value of $1.7 trillion, making it the world’s fifth-most valuable firm, behind Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA and Alphabet, which owns Google. Aramco stock meanwhile has fallen by nearly a fifth over the past year as oil prices dropped. Aramco reported making a $121 billion profit in 2023, down from its 2022 record due to lower energy prices. Saudi Arabia’s vast oil resources, located close to the surface of its desert expanse, make it one of the world’s least expensive places to produce crude. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman hopes to use the oil wealth to pivot the kingdom off oil sales, through projects such as his planned $500 billion futuristic desert city, called Neom. But lower oil prices have Saudi Arabia reportedly looking at curtailing some of those ambitions as the kingdom likely faces looming budget deficits. Meanwhile, activists criticized the profits amid global concerns about the burning of fossil fuels accelerating climate change."

The scary Monday started with a plunge abroad reminiscent of 1987 ’s crash swept around the world and pummeled Wall Street with more steep losses, as fears worsened about a slowing U.S. economy. The S&P 500 dropped 3% for its worst day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average reeled by 1,033 points, or 2.6%, while the Nasdaq composite slid 3.4% as Apple, Nvidia and other Big Tech companies that used to be the stars of the stock market continued to wilt. The drops were the latest in a global sell-off that began last week, and it was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday’s report showing U.S. employers slowed their hiring last month by much more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the U.S. economy to come in weaker than expected , and it’s all raised fear the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the U.S. economy by too much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling inflation . Professional investors cautioned that some technical factors could be amplifying the action in markets, and that the drops may be overdone, but the losses were still neck-snapping. South Korea’s Kospi index careened 8.8% lower, and bitcoin dropped below $54,000 from more than $61,000 on Friday. Even gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during tumultuous times, slipped about 1%.  That’s in part because traders began wondering if the damage has been so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed, briefly sank below 3.70% during the morning from 3.88% late Friday and from 5% in April. It later recovered and pulled back to 3.89%. “The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “Those are usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate of 4.3% doesn’t really seem like an emergency.” Of course, the U.S. economy is still growing , the U.S. stock market is still up a healthy amount for the year and a recession is far from a certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen and hurt everyone. Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a recession within the next 12 months following Friday’s jobs report. But he still sees only a 25% probability of that, up from 15%, in part “because the data look fine overall” and he does not “see major financial imbalances.” Some of Wall Street’s recent declines may simply be air coming out of a stock market that romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Critics have been saying for a while that the stock market looked expensive after prices rose faster than corporate profits. “Markets tend to move higher like they’re climbing stairs, and they go down like they’re falling out a window,” according to JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America. He chalks much of the recent worries to euphoria around AI subsiding, with pressure rising on companies to show how AI is turning into profits, and “a market that was ahead of itself.” The only way for stocks to look less expensive is either for prices to fall or for their profits to strengthen. Expectations are still high for the latter, with growth for S&P 500 profits this past quarter looking to be the strongest since 2021. Professional investors also pointed to the Bank of Japan’s move last week to raise its main interest rate from nearly zero . Such a move helps boost the value of the Japanese yen, but it could also force traders to scramble out of deals where they borrowed money for virtually no cost in Japan and invested it elsewhere around the world. Treasury yields also pared their losses Monday after a report said growth for U.S. services businesses was a touch stronger than expected. Growth was led by arts, entertainment and recreation businesses, along with accommodations and food services, according to the Institute for Supply Management. Still, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the economy’s strength took sharp losses on the fears about a slowdown. The small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 3.3%, washing out what had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market. Making things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks tumbled as the market’s most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel. Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the “ Magnificent Seven ” had propelled the S&P 500 to record after record this year, even as high interest rates weighed down much of the rest of the stock market. But Big Tech’s momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports that began with updates from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism and accelerated the declines. Apple fell 4.8% Monday after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it had slashed its ownership stake in the iPhone maker. Nvidia , the chip company that’s become the poster child of Wall Street’s AI bonanza, fell even more, 6.4%. Analysts cut their profit forecasts over the weekend for the company after a report from The Information said Nvidia’s new AI chip is delayed. The recent selling has trimmed Nvidia’s gain for the year to nearly 103% from 170% in the middle of June. Another Big Tech titan, Alphabet, fell 4.4% after a U.S. judge ruled Google’s search engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation. All told, the S&P 500 fell 160.23 points to 5,186.33. The Dow sank 1,033.99 to 38,703.27, and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 576.08 to 16,200.08. Worries outside corporate profits, interest rates and the economy are also weighing on the market. The Israel-Hamas war may be worsening, which beyond its human toll could cause sharp swings for the price of oil. That’s adding to broader worries about potential hotspots around the world, while upcoming U.S. elections could further scramble things. Wall Street has been concerned about how policies coming out of November could impact markets, but the sharp swings for stock prices could affect the election itself. The threat of a recession is likely to put Vice President Kamala Harris on the defensive. But slower growth could also further reduce inflation and force former President Donald Trump to pivot from his current focus on higher prices to outlining ways to revive the economy. “It comes down to jobs,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. Jobs drive spending by U.S. consumers, which in turn is the biggest part of the U.S. economy. “When we get to election day, the unemployment rate is going to be extremely important.” AP Business Writers Elaine Kurtenbach, Matt Ott, Christopher Rugaber and Damian J.

        "headline": "The Fed’s high rates spur fear of slowdown, yet recession signals have so far proved wrong",
        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The turmoil shaking global financial markets reflects a sudden fear that the Federal Reserve may have held its key interest rate too high for too long, heightening the risk of a U.S. recession. Economists and Wall Street traders now expect the Fed to cut its benchmark rate, which influences borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, much faster than they thought just a week ago. Chair Jerome Powell has often stressed that the Fed could quickly lower rates if it decides that it’s needed to bolster the economy.  Yet the periodic fear of a forthcoming recession has been a hallmark of the post-pandemic economy — and has proved wrong every time. Instead, contrary to what most analysts have predicted, steady economic growth and a solid pace of hiring have endured. In the past, the U.S. economy would often flash telltale signals when it was in or near a recession. But those red lights have gone haywire since the COVID-19 pandemic struck and upended normal business activity. The latest red flag was Friday’s July jobs report from the Labor Department, which showed that the unemployment rate rose from 4.1% to 4.3% — still a relatively low level but the highest rate in nearly three years. Markets panicked after the report was released, in part because it set off the so-called Sahm Rule. Stocks tumbled again on Monday, after share prices overseas had plunged. The Dow Jones index plummeted more than 1,030 points, or 2.6%.  Named for Claudia Sahm, a former Fed economist, the rule has found that since 1970, a recession has always been underway once the three-month average unemployment rate has risen by half a percentage point from its low of the previous year. The logic behind the rule is that unemployment can be self-sustaining: As more people lose jobs, they cut back their spending, harming other companies, which then stop hiring or even cut workers. Yet the Sahm Rule could be yet another recession signal that turns out to be a false alarm. Sahm herself doubts that a recession is imminent.  The rule is typically triggered when companies start cutting jobs, thereby raising the unemployment rate. Yet now, unemployment has been rising not because companies are slashing jobs but because so many people have poured into the job market. Not all of them have found work right away. Jay Bryson, chief economist at Wells Fargo, thinks the risk of recession has risen along with the unemployment rate. But he ultimately thinks the economy will pull through. “The good news here,” he said, “is that there haven’t been any major shocks hitting the economy,” such as a spike in oil prices or a housing bust. “Absent a shock, it’s a bit more challenging to get into a recession.” Other previously notable recession indicators that have flopped in the post-pandemic era include: — A bond market measure with a dry-as-dust label: The “inverted yield curve.’’ — The rule of thumb that two consecutive quarters of shrinking economic output amount to a “technical recession.’’ Last week, Powell said that while he was aware of the Sahm Rule and its implications, other recession signals, such as changes in bond yields, haven’t been borne out in recent years. “This pandemic era has been one in which so many apparent rules have been flouted,” he said at a news conference. “Many received pieces of received wisdom just haven’t worked, and it’s because the situation really is unusual or unique.” Powell spoke after the central bank kept its key rate unchanged but signaled that it could reduce the rate as soon as the next policy meeting in September . Financial markets and most economists now think the Fed will end up cutting rates fairly quickly this year, in part to offset economic weakness. Bryson expects half-point cuts in the Fed’s benchmark rate in September and November and an additional quarter-point cut in December. That is much faster than Wells Fargo’s previous forecast of just two quarter-point rate cuts this year, in September and December. Some analysts have speculated that the Fed could reduce its rate at an emergency meeting before September. But most economists doubt that the officials would take such a step, unless there were further signs of economic weakness. “Historically, the (Fed) has as only delivered inter-meeting cuts ... when there was a clear negative shock or when the data were worse than they have been so far,” Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle wrote in note. For four years, economists have struggled to make sense of an economy that was first shut down by the COVID-19 pandemic, then roared back with such strength that it revived inflationary pressures that had lain dormant for four decades. When the Fed moved to tame inflation by aggressively raising rates starting in March 2022, economists almost uniformly predicted that the higher borrowing costs would cause a recession. It never came . The central bank raised its rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023, and the phenomenon known as the “inverted yield curve” soon followed. An inverted yield curve occurs when the interest rate on shorter-term Treasury bonds, such two-year notes, rises above the rate on a longer-term bond, such as the 10-year Treasury. That happened in July 2022, and yields remained inverted until Monday, when the 2-year briefly fell below the 10-year yield. Typically, longer-term bonds have higher yields to compensate investors for locking up their money for an extended period of time. When shorter-term bonds start paying out higher yields instead, it usually occurs because markets expect the Fed to crank up its short-term rate and keep it high to quell inflation or cool the economy. Such steps often lead to a recession. An inverted yield curve has preceded each of the last 10 recessions, according to Deutsche Bank, usually by about one to two years. It did provide one false signal in 1967, when an inversion occurred but no downturn followed. Tiffany Wilding, an economist and managing director at bond giant PIMCO, says one reason it hasn’t worked this time is that the government’s huge financial assistance packages, totaling roughly $5 trillion in 2020 and 2021, enriched consumers and business alike. As a result, they have been able to spend and invest without borrowing as much, muting the impact of the Fed’s rate hikes and dulling the signal from the inverted yield curve. Also in 2022, the government reported that gross domestic product — the economy’s output of goods and services — had fallen for two straight quarters, a longtime rule of thumb that has often accompanied a recession. The top-line economic numbers did show that economic output was falling. But another measure in the GDP report told a different story: Stripping out volatile items such as inventories, government spending and imports, it showed that the underlying economy continued to expand at a healthy pace.

        "headline": "Stock market today: Dow drops 600 on weak jobs data as a global sell-off whips back to Wall Street",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks tumbled Friday on worries the U.S. economy could be cracking under the weight of high interest rates meant to whip inflation . The S&P 500 sank 1.8% for its first back-to-back losses of at least 1% since April. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 610 points, or 1.5%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 2.4% as a sell-off for stocks whipped all the way around the world back to Wall Street. A report showing hiring by U.S. employers slowed last month by much more than economists expected sent fear through markets, with both stocks and bond yields dropping sharply. It followed a batch of weaker-than-expected reports on the economy from a day earlier, including a worsening for U.S. manufacturing activity, which has been one of the areas hurt most by high rates. It was just a couple days ago that U.S. stock indexes jumped to their best day in months after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave the clearest indication yet that inflation has slowed enough for cuts to rates to begin in September. Now, worries are rising the Fed may have kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high for too long. A rate cut would make it easier for U.S. households and companies to borrow money and boost the economy, but it could take months to a year for the full effects to filter through. “The Fed is seizing defeat from the jaws of victory,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “Economic momentum has slowed so much that a rate cut in September will be too little and too late. They’ll have to do something bigger than” the traditional cut of a quarter of a percentage point “to avert a recession.”  Traders are now betting on a 70% probability that the Fed will cut its main interest rate by half a percentage point in September, according to data from CME Group. That’s even though Powell said Wednesday that such a deep reduction is “not something we’re thinking about right now.” Of course, the U.S. economy is still growing, and a recession is far from a certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it’s walking since it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more oxygen. While refusing to claim victory on either the jobs or the inflation fronts on Wednesday, before the discouraging economic reports hit, Powell said Fed officials “have a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness” in the job market after hiking its main rate so high. “Certainly today’s job data feeds the weakening economy narrative, but I believe the market is overreacting at this point and pricing too much in on rate cuts at this stage,” said Nate Thooft, senior portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management. “Yes, the economy is weakening, but I am not convinced there is enough evidence that the data so far is a death knell for the economy.” U.S. stocks had already appeared to be headed for losses Friday before the disappointing jobs report thudded onto Wall Street. Several big technology companies turned in underwhelming profit reports, which continued a mostly dispiriting run that began last week with results from Tesla and Alphabet . Amazon fell 8.8% after reporting weaker revenue for the latest quarter than expected . The retail and tech giant also gave a forecast for operating profit for the summer that fell short of analysts’ expectations. Intel dropped even more, 26.1%, for its worst day in 50 years, after the chip company’s profit for the latest quarter fell well short of forecasts . It also suspended its dividend payment and forecast a loss for the third quarter, when analysts were expecting a profit. Apple held steadier, up 0.7%, after reporting better profit and revenue than expected . Apple and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the “ Magnificent Seven ” were the main reasons the S&P 500 set dozens of records this year, in part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. But their momentum turned last month on worries investors had taken their prices too high. Friday’s losses for tech stocks dragged the Nasdaq composite 10% below its record set last month. That level of drop is what traders call a “correction.” Helpfully for Wall Street, other areas of the stock market beaten down by high interest rates began rebounding sharply last month when tech stocks were regressing, particularly smaller companies. But they tumbled too Friday on worries that a fragile economy could undercut their profits. The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks dropped 3.5%, more than the rest of the market. All told, the S&P 500 fell 100.12 points to 5,346.56. The Dow dropped 610.71 to 39.737.26, and the Nasdaq composite fell 417.98 to 16,776.16. In the bond market, Treasury yields fell sharply as traders forecasted deeper cuts to rates coming from the Federal Reserve. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 3.79% from 3.98% late Thursday and from 4.70% in April. In stock markets abroad, Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 5.8%. It’s been struggling since the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. The hike pushed up the value of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar, which could hurt profits for exporters and deflate a boom in tourism. Chinese stocks fell as investors registered disappointment with the government’s latest efforts to spur growth through various piecemeal measures, instead of hoped-for infusions of broader stimulus, while stock indexes dropped by more than 1% across much of Europe. Commodity prices also had a rough ride this week. Oil prices leaped after the killings of leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah fueled fears that a widening conflict in the Middle East could disrupt the flow of crude. But prices fell back Thursday and Friday on worries that a weakening economy would burn less fuel. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude dropped back below $74 Friday after coming into the week above $77.

        "headline": "US hiring fell sharply in July, an unexpected setback for the economy stoking recession fears",
        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. economy suffered an unexpected setback in July as hiring fell sharply and the unemployment rate rose for the fourth straight month with raised interest rates taking a toll on businesses and households. Employers added just 114,000 jobs in July — 35% fewer than expected — and unemployment, now at 4.3%, is the highest since October 2021, the Labor Department reported Friday. “Things are deteriorating quickly,’’ said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. The sharp downturn in U.S. hiring shook financial markets around the world. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 610 points, or 1.5%. The S&P 500 tumbled 1.8%. The sturdy U.S. economy has been a key driver of global economic growth and the U.S. jobs market has been the fuel, giving Americans the confidence and financial wherewithal to keep spending. The unemployment rate’s jump to 4.3% in July crossed a tripwire that historically has signaled recession — though economists say the gauge probably is not reliable in the post-pandemic economy. Hiring may have been disrupted by Hurricane Beryl, which slammed the Texas economy last month. And ZipRecruiter’s Pollak noted employers have cut worker hours and made temporary layoffs — suggesting that they are optimistic a rate cut may turn things around. “They are just slowing hiring and putting people on temporary layoff, furlough,” Pollak said. “They want to get back to business. They see lots of opportunities to expand. They they just need rates to be (lower).’'  The Federal Reserve said this week that in needed to see more evidence inflation is moving toward its 2% target before it cuts rates. Chair Jerome Powell characterized the American job market as healthy despite calls for the central bank to begin lowering its benchmark rate, which stands at a 23-year high. Hourly wages rose just 3.6% from July 2023, the smallest year-over-year gain since May 2021, and another sign that inflation could be heading closer to the Fed’s target. July job gains were concentrated in a few industries. Healthcare and social assistance firms added 64,000 jobs last month, accounting for 56% of hiring. Restaurants, hotels and bars added nearly 26,000 jobs. Labor Department revisions, however, clipped 29,000 jobs from May-June payrolls. This year, the economy has generated nearly 203,000 jobs a month, solid but down from 251,000 last year, 377,000 in 2022 and a record 604,000 in 2021, when the job market roared back from pandemic lockdowns. The economy is weighing heavily on voters’ minds ahead of the November presidential election. Many Americans have been unimpressed after three years of strong job gains, exasperated instead by high prices . Two years after inflation hit a four-decade high, price increases have eased but consumers are still paying 19% more for goods and services than they were in spring 2021. The so-called Sahm Rule , named for the former Fed economist who came up with it, Claudia Sahm, holds that a recession is almost always already underway if the unemployment rate (based on a three-month moving average) rises by half a percentage point from its low of the past year. The jump to 4.3% unemployment crosses that threshold. Still, Sahm, now chief economist at New Century Advisors, said before Friday’s report that this time “a recession is not imminent’’ even if the Sahm Rule were triggered. That is partly because America’s jobs numbers have been upended by an unexpected surge in immigration — much of it illegal — over the past couple of years. The new arrivals have poured into the American labor force and eased labor shortages across the economy — but not all have found jobs right away, pushing up unemployment. People who have entered the country illegally are also less inclined to respond to Labor Department surveys, meaning they may go uncounted as employed. On Wednesday, the Fed signaled that it would likely cut rates in September from its current level of 5.3%. The slowdown in hiring has spurred calls from economists and Wall Street for a half-point cut by the Fed, rather than the more traditional quarter-point. Powell downplayed that possibility Wednesday, though he did not rule it out. A break on borrowing costs could not come soon enough for many business owners. Chris Maher is CEO OceanFirst Bank in Red Bank, New Jersey, which works with 20,000 small businesses from restaurants and hotels to car dealerships. Maher said those businesses have pulled back on hiring since Memorial Day as its customers grow more cautious. A Fed rate cut in September could boost businesses like home construction and car dealerships by cutting the cost of loans, leading to a pickup in hiring, Maher said, but he remains cautious. At the Barrel Room, a San Francisco wine bar and restaurant, founder Sarah Trubnick is puzzled by what’s happening with the economy. After an “insanely busy’’ first three months of 2024, she had high hopes for the rest of the year. But business plummeted over the summer, and she doesn’t know why. She had to lay off four workers and now has 10 at the business she founded in 2011. “We had been in business for many years,’’ she said. “So we were very familiar with the patterns, and we knew when to bring on more people, when to expect difficult times. And we knew we had to have a financial cushion at times. We had it all down to a science. And post-COVID I can’t figure out the pattern.’’ The Labor Department reported Thursday that 1.88 million Americans were collecting unemployment benefits the week of July 20, most since November 2021 – and a sign that those without a job are likely struggling to find a new one. Julian Cannon, 34, of New York lost his job as a reporter at a online publication back in December. He’s applied for hundreds of jobs with no luck. One company interviewed him eight times for several positions, then ended up hiring a candidate who already worked there. “I’m still looking, and I’m at a breaking point,’’ he said.

        "headline": "Bank of Japan raises its key interest rate, aiming to curb yen’s slide against the dollar",
        "content": "TOKYO (AP) — The Bank of Japan raised its key interest rate Wednesday to about 0.25% from a range of zero to about 0.1%, acting to curb the yen’s slide against the U.S. dollar. The move was widely expected, and the yen gained sharply against the dollar ahead of and after Wednesday’s decision, trading below 152 yen. Concerns have been deepening about the yen’s recent drop to 160-yen levels to the dollar. That hurts an economy that imports almost all its oil, as well as other items like food. The decision on the overnight call rate came just four months after the central bank raised its key rate above zero for the first time in 17 years. Bank of Japan Gov. Kazuo Ueda told reporters the action came because the foundation of the Japanese economy was relatively solid, with gradual price rises accompanied by wage increases, despite worries about personal spending holding up as prices rose. He acknowledged additional rate hikes may be coming within this year, depending on how the economy holds up, including how the latest rate increases may affect economic activity and prices. He declined to give a specific date. “In the long term, we think that adjusting longtime extremely low interest rates shouldn’t be rushed, and overall risks can be reduced,” he said. Share prices in Tokyo rose after the decision, with Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 finishing 1.5% higher. Japan’s central bank has kept interest rates near or below zero for nearly a decade, seeking to spur inflation in what has been a deflationary economy, hoping to sustain stronger growth for one of the world’s largest economies.  Ueda said Wednesday that he did not want to come out and say that Japan had escaped deflation, but he stressed that prices seemed to be steadily increasing. The zero-rate strategy was controversial. When wages failed to keep pace with price increases, consumers tended to spend less rather than more. A weak yen has pushed prices in Japan higher since it makes imported gas, oil and other necessities more expensive. The main index of inflation has exceeded the BOJ’s target of about 2% for months. “Inflation expectations of firms and households have risen moderately,” the BOJ said in its policy statement. “The year-on-year rate of change in import prices has turned positive again, and upside risks to prices require attention.” The ultra-lax monetary policy also involved massive central bank purchases of Japanese government bonds and other assets to inject cash into the economy. The BOJ has been moving toward unwinding that but was wary of stifling growth by raising the cost of borrowing. On Wednesday, it said it would reduce the amount of its purchases, long at tens of trillions of yen a month, so that they will be about 3 trillion yen ($19 billion) in the January-March quarter of 2026, or about half of the current 6 trillion yen ($39 billion). Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, noted the Bank of Japan had used language that “was quite bullish on prices,” meaning that more hikes were likely. Analysts say the central bank’s focus was on what many see as the overly weak yen, while taking care not to set off any negatively dramatic overreactions in the economy. The central bank shifted away from a negative policy rate only in March, raising the overnight call rate for banks to 0.1% from minus 0.1%. The dollar’s gains have reflected high interest rates in the United States, where the Federal Reserve is forecast to cut its main rate in September and to hold steady at a policy meeting later Wednesday. The Bank of England was due to issue a rate decision on Thursday."

        "headline": "USDA bans school lunch fees for low-income families",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that students eligible for free or reduced price school meals cannot be charged processing fees beginning in 2027. School districts currently work with processing companies to offer cashless payment systems for families. But the companies can charge “processing fees” for each transaction. By law, students who are eligible for reduced price meals cannot be charged more than 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. With processing fees, however, families can end up paying 10 times that amount. Processing companies charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. For families with lower incomes who can’t afford to load large sums in one go, processing fees can arrive weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report. The new Agriculture Department’s policy becomes effective starting in the 2027-2028 school year. With this rule, the USDA will lower costs for families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines, which equals $57,720 for a family of four. “USDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grow and thrive,” said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement Friday. “While today’s action to eliminate extra fees for lower-income households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full potential.”  The decision by the USDA follows a CFPB report that found online school meal payments predominantly affect low-income families. School lunch fees collectively cost families upwards of $100 million each year, according to the report. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has mandated that school districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome. “It’s just massively inconvenient,” said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children. Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead. “A dollar here and there, I expected,” she said. “But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower — as are the salaries — is a lot.” Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school lunches which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point. In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child’s account. While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures “may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.” Just three companies — MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect — dominate the market, according to the report. Without the ability to choose which company to work with, “families have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices,” the agency said, “including those that may violate federal consumer protection law.” “The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Between finding openings, sending out your resume and interviewing, looking for a job is tough. Now a growing trend of scammers impersonating recruiters is making it even harder. In the last year, job scams have been on the rise, according to Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that helps consumers when their identities are compromised. Because most job seekers turn to online platforms for employment, scammers impersonate companies and recruiters to trick people into giving them money or personal information. “We’ve really seen tremendous growth in job scams,” Velasquez said. “I think that’s just due to the fact that we fundamentally changed the way we recruit and hire people.” It happened to Tehseen Islam, a 28-year-old quality assurance analyst. She had been looking for a job for a few months when she finally got an offer from a well-known marketing technology company. Or at least she thought she did. After a weeklong process that included an online form with interview screening questions, Islam was offered the job and received a check. She was asked to deposit it and send the company $1,000 to pay for shipment of equipment she’d need for the job. A few days later, her bank notified her that the check had bounced and, because it looked like she was cooperating with scammers, it was ending all banking relationships with her. That’s when she learned the job was a scam.  “I’m a little traumatized,” said Islam, who lost the $1,000 and unknowingly shared personal information with scammers. If you’re a job seeker, here are some recommendations from experts on how to avoid job scammers: Job scams are a type of impersonation scam . Scammers tend to use the name of an employee from a large company and craft a job posting that matches similar positions. An initial red flag is that scammers usually try to make the job very appealing, Velasquez said. “They’re going to have very high salaries for somewhat low-skilled work,” she said. “And they’re often saying it’s a 100% remote position because that’s so appealing to people.” Some scammers post fake jobs, but others reach out directly to job seekers through direct messages or texts. If the scammers are looking to steal your personal information, they may ask you to fill out several forms that include information like your Social Security number and driver’s license details. The only information a legitimate employer should ask for at the beginning of the process is your skills, your work experience, and your contact information, Velasquez said. Other details don’t generally need to be shared with an employer until after you’ve gotten an offer. Whether you’re replying to a job posting or a recruiter, you must research the company, especially if you didn’t initiate the conversation, Velasquez said. Fake recruiters often contact job seekers through social media or text messages. If someone reaches out to you, verify their identity before responding to their message. Here are a few recommendations while you research the recruiter or the company: — Don’t respond to the message right away. — Go online and research if the company has current job openings on its official website. — Research the name of the recruiter and check if the person has a verifiable social media presence. — If the company has a job opening on its website, apply directly through the website. If you receive a message from a recruiter, it’s best to not respond unless you know that the source is reputable. Avoid clicking on any links sent to you, whether to apply for a position or to fill out a questionnaire. In Islam’s case, the scammers sent her a form with interview screening questions where they asked for her personal information. A common tactic is for scammers to send you a fake signing bonus and then ask you to send some money back, supposedly to cover expenses. This is a way for scammers to steal money from job seekers, said Alvaro Puig, consumer education specialist at the Federal Trade Commission. “If you deposit a check and it’s fake, your account will show the money is there. But then days later, the bank will discover that it was a fake check,” Puig said. So, if you take out money from your account and send it to the fake recruiter, the money will be coming from your bank account and it will be impossible to get back. When job hunting through platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed, Velasquez recommends being very cautious with job openings and recruiters you trust. While these platforms are reputable and many of their job postings are real, the companies cannot verify every single employment opportunity posted. This creates an opportunity for scammers to post fake job listings and trick people. “Don’t let platforms that you know are legitimate allow other people to borrow that trust,” Velasquez said. After her experience with job scammers, Islam has been more careful with the job openings she trusts. Now, she has a list of steps she follows, including verifying a recruiter’s email through a free email address validator, such as Emailable or Clearout, and calling the company directly. “This is adding a lot more time to my job search now but I can’t just blindly trust that this person is who they say they are,” Islam said. If you or a family member is a victim of a scam, it’s good practice to report it on the FTC’s website .

        "headline": "October is Cybersecurity Awareness Month. Here’s how to stay safe from scams",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — October is Cybersecurity Awareness Month, which means it’s the perfect time to learn how to protect yourself from scams. “Scams have become so sophisticated now. Phishing emails, texts, spoofing caller ID, all of this technology gives scammers that edge,” said Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center. As scammers find new ways to steal money and personal information, consumers should be more vigilant about who they trust, especially online. A quick way to remember what to do when you think you’re getting scammed is to think about the three S’s, said Alissa Abdullah, also known as Dr. Jay, Mastercard’s deputy chief security officer “Stay suspicious, stop for a second (and think about it) and stay protected,” she said. Whether it’s romance scams or job scams, impersonators are looking for ways to trick you into giving them money or sharing your personal information. Here’s what to know: Three common tactics used by scammers are based on fear, urgency and money, said security expert Petros Efstathopoulos. Here’s how they work: — Fear When a scammer contacts you via phone or email, they use language that makes it seem like there is a problem that you need to solve. For example, a scammer contacts you over email telling you that your tax return has an error and if you don’t fix it you’ll get in trouble. — Urgency Because scammers are good at creating a sense of urgency, people tend to rush, which makes them vulnerable. Scammers often tell people they need to act right away, which can lead to them sharing private information such as their Social Security numbers.  — Money Scammers use money as bait, Efstathopoulos said. They might impersonate tax professionals or the IRS saying you will get a bigger tax refund than you expect if you pay them for their services or share your personal information. Simply being aware of typical scams can help, experts say. Robocalls in particular frequently target vulnerable individuals like seniors, people with disabilities, and people with debt. “If you get a robocall out of the blue paying a recorded message trying to get you to buy something, just hang up,” said James Lee, chief operating officer at the Identity Theft Resource Center. “Same goes for texts — anytime you get them from a number you don’t know asking you to pay, wire, or click on something suspicious.” Lee urges consumers to hang up and call the company or institution in question at an official number. Scammers will also often imitate someone in authority, such as a tax or debt collector. They might pretend to be a loved one calling to request immediate financial assistance for bail, legal help, or a hospital bill. So-called “romance scams” often target lonely and isolated individuals, according to Will Maxson, assistant director of the Division of Marketing Practices at the FTC. These scams can take place over longer periods of time -- even years. Kate Kleinart, 70, who lost tens of thousands to a romance scam over several months, said to be vigilant if a new Facebook friend is exceptionally good-looking, asks you to download WhatsApp to communicate, attempts to isolate you from friends and family, and/or gets romantic very quickly. “If you’re seeing that picture of a very handsome person, ask someone younger in your life — a child, a grandchild, a niece or a nephew — to help you reverse-image search or identify the photo,” she said. She said the man in pictures she received was a plastic surgeon from Spain whose photos have been stolen and used by scammers. Kleinart had also been living under lockdown during the early pandemic when she got the initial friend request, and the companionship and communication meant a lot to her while she was cut off from family. When the scam fell apart, she missed the relationship even more than the savings. “Losing the love was worse than losing the money,” she said. Job scams involve a person pretending to be a recruiter or a company in order to steal money or information from a job seeker. Scammers tend to use the name of an employee from a large company and craft a job posting that matches similar positions. An initial red flag is that scammers usually try to make the job very appealing, Velasquez said. “They’re going to have very high salaries for somewhat low-skilled work,” she said. “And they’re often saying it’s a 100% remote position because that’s so appealing to people.” Some scammers post fake jobs, but others reach out directly to job seekers through direct messages or texts. If the scammers are looking to steal your personal information, they may ask you to fill out several forms that include information like your Social Security number and driver’s license details. The only information a legitimate employer should ask for at the beginning of the process is your skills, your work experience, and your contact information, Velasquez said. Other details don’t generally need to be shared with an employer until after you’ve gotten an offer. According to Lois Greisman, an associate director of marketing practices at the Federal Trade Commission, an investment scam constitutes any get-rich-quick scheme that lures targets via social media accounts or online ads. Investment scammers typically add different forms of “testimony,” such as from other social media accounts, to support that the “investment” works. Many of these also involve cryptocurrency. To avoid falling for these frauds, the FTC recommends independently researching the company — especially by searching the company’s name along with terms like “review” or “scam.” When you’re using Facebook or scrolling Google results, be aware of quiz scams , which typically appear innocuous and ask about topics you might be interested in, such as your car or favorite TV show. They may also ask you to take a personality test. Despite these benign-seeming questions, scammers can then use the personal information you share to respond to security questions from your accounts or hack your social media to send malware links to your contacts. To protect your personal information, the FTC simply recommends steering clear of online quizzes . The commission also advises consumers to use random answers for security questions. “Asked to enter your mother’s maiden name? Say it’s something else: Parmesan or another word you’ll remember,” advises Terri Miller, consumer education specialist at the FTC. “This way, scammers won’t be able to use information they find to steal your identity.” When buying or selling products on Instagram or Facebook Marketplace, keep in mind that not everyone that reaches out to you has the best intentions. To avoid being scammed when selling via an online platform, the FTC recommends checking buyers’ profiles, not sharing any codes sent to your phone or email, and avoiding accepting online payments from unknown persons. Likewise, when buying something from an online marketplace , make sure to diligently research the seller. Take a look at whether the profile is verified, what kind of reviews they have, and the terms and conditions of the purchase. Scammers often reach out by phone, Ben Hoffman, Head of Strategy and Consumer Products at Fifth Third Bank recommends that you don’t pick up unknown incoming calls. “Banks don’t ask your for your password,” said Hoffman. If you believe your bank is trying to reach out, give them a call at a number listed on their website. This makes it easier to know for sure that you’re not talking to a scammer. As a general rule, banks don’t often call unless there is suspicious activity on your account or if you previously contacted them about a problem. If you receive many unknown calls that end up being scammers or robocalls, you can use tools available on your phone to block spam. Check here for how to do this on your iPhone and here for Android . There are many tools are your disposal that can be used to protect yourself from scammers online. — Use a password manager to ensure you’re utilizing a complex password that scammers can’t guess. — Regularly checking your credit report and bank statements is a good practice since it can help you identify if someone has been using your bank account without your knowledge. — Turn on multi-factor verification to make sure impersonators aren’t able to access your social media or bank accounts. As scams get more sophisticated, it’s difficult to know who to trust or if a person is actually real, or an impersonator. If you aren’t sure if a job recruiter is real or if your bank is actually asking your for information, find organizations that can help you, recommended Velasquez. Organizations like the Identity Theft Protection Center and the AARP Fraud Watch Network offer free services for customers who need help identifying scams or knowing what to do if you’ve been a victim of a scam. If you’ve taken all the necessary steps to protect yourself, you might want to help those around you. Whether you’re helping your grandparents to block unknown callers on their phones or sharing tips with your neighbors, talking with others about how to protect themselves from scams can be very effective. If you or a family member is a victim of a scam, it’s good practice to report it on the FTC’s website .

        "headline": "Why you shouldn’t store your money in payment apps",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Connor Tomasko grew up wary of credit cards. As she taught herself more about managing money, she realized that many people also have bad habits when it comes to payment apps. Tomasko, 31, a freelance software consultant in Chicago, understands why people appreciate the ease of the apps, which typically only require you to know someone’s username in order to send money. But she realized that keeping money in the apps could be risky and means losing out on the interest from a high yield savings account. She now immediately transfers any payments out of the apps and encourages friends to do the same. “I’m definitely the one that is always harping about high yield savings accounts,” Tomasko said. “But if you’re in an industry dealing with a lot of cash — bartending, say — sometimes you’re just worried about finding a place to deposit it. It’s not always a fun thing to talk about.” As use of payment apps has grown in recent years, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has issued guidance on best practices to avoid pitfalls. For example, funds stored on Venmo or Cash App typically lack the deposit insurance you’d get from a bank, except in certain cases. “Popular digital payment apps are increasingly used as substitutes for a traditional bank or credit union account, but lack the same protections to ensure that funds are safe,” CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a bulletin last year.  In 2022, transaction volume on these apps was an estimated $893 billion, according to the CFPB, and that’s projected to reach $1.6 trillion by 2027. More than three-quarters of US adults say they have ever used one of four popular payment apps, according to a 2022 survey from the Pew Research Center . Of consumers ages 18 to 29, 85% said they’ve used a service such as PayPal, Venmo, Apple Cash, Google Pay, or Zelle, according to a March 2022 study by Consumer Reports . “The apps are popular because you don’t have to give your personal information, like a phone number, if you just got drinks with someone once but you’re never going to see them again — a date that didn’t go well,” Tomasko said. “I get the benefits in that sense — to be able to send money that way.” Here’s what you should know: “It may be tempting to leave money sitting in peer-to-peer lending accounts so that you’re ready to pay your friends when they request money to cover your portion of a dinner bill... (but) there are a few reasons why we wouldn’t suggest doing that,” said Courtney Alev, consumer advocate at Credit Karma. Funds stored in payment apps often lack deposit insurance, the CFPB has found. FDIC-insured banks protect depositors against the loss of their insured deposits up to at least $250,000 if a bank fails, and a similar framework protects credit unions. While funds stored on payment apps resemble funds stored on deposit accounts, those funds are not typically covered until they have been transferred back to an FDIC-insured bank or insured credit union. The Financial Technology Association, an industry group that includes many payment apps as members, noted that Cash App and PayPal both offer separate high-yield, FDIC-insured savings products. In select circumstances, deposit insurance does cover payment apps. With Cash App, funds are eligible for insurance if consumers link their account to a Cash App debit card. And with Venmo, funds added to an account via direct deposit or check cashing are covered. Still, the CFPB has found that funds stored in a payment app “may be at significantly higher risk of loss for a consumer than if it is deposited in an insured bank or credit union account.” “Consumers should be aware of these risks if they choose to leave a balance on these nonbank payment apps,” the agency wrote in its report last year. To minimize risks, the CFPB said consumers should “transfer their balances back” to federally insured accounts. Some payment app companies are able to invest users’ funds in loans and bonds, earning money on the investments while generally paying no interest on users’ balances, the CFPB found. To maximize your own funds, immediately transfer any deposits to an account where you can collect interest. “Leaving money sitting in those accounts is leaving potential interest from a high-yield savings account on the table,” said Alev. “All of that interest adds up over time, so your money could be growing elsewhere.” Tomasko said she always uses the ‘1-3 business day’ option to transfer funds when using Venmo, to avoid incurring fees, while Cash App has a setting that users can select to automatically route money back to their bank accounts, which she uses. “There’s definitely room for improvement in the space,” she said. “With Venmo, every time I receive a payment, I go in to actively transfer it out.” The Financial Technology Association said in a statement that “tens of millions of Americans use payment apps every day to send money to friends and family, cover routine expenses, and manage their finances.” “Consumers choose these apps because they are safe, convenient, and transparent,” said FTA CEO and President Penny Lee. This story has been updated to correct the name of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the name of Apple’s peer-to-peer payment app. The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

        "headline": "What to know about this year’s Social Security cost-of-living adjustment",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Tens of millions of older Americans will see an increase in benefits this January when a new cost-of-living adjustment is added to Social Security payments. The 2.5% raise is intended to help meet higher prices for food, fuel, and other goods and services. The average recipient will see an increase of about $50 per month, according to agency officials. Social Security recipients received a 3.2% increase in their benefits in 2024, and some retirees are concerned that this year’s increase is not big enough to meet their needs. The Social Security Administration will begin notifying recipients about their new benefit amount by mail starting in early December. Adjusted payments to nearly 7.5 million people receiving Supplemental Security Income will begin on December 31. Supplemental Security Income provides monthly payments to adults and children who have income below specific financial limits and qualify to receive Social Security benefits. Here’s what to keep in mind: About 72.5 million people, including retirees, disabled people and children, get Social Security benefits. The program is funded by taxes on income subject to Social Security payroll taxes. The government uses taxes from working people to pay benefits to people who have already retired, people who are disabled, the survivors of workers who have died, and dependents of beneficiaries . In 2025, the Social Security payroll tax will be assessed on the first $176,100 of income, up from $168,600 this year This story is featured in our One Notable Number series , which spotlights the key numbers leading our coverage. Take a look at more Notable Numbers here. You can also read more ONEs: While the money is used to pay people currently receiving benefits, any unused money goes to the Social Security trust fund. Some of the money in the trust, together with the Social Security contributions of people in the workforce, pays for future benefits. To determine what amount of Social Security you’ll receive, the government calculates a percentage of your highest wages from your top 35 years of earning, factoring in when you choose to start receiving benefits. The COLA is calculated according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index, but there are calls to use a different index — one that measures price changes based on the spending patterns of the elderly — like healthcare, food and medicine costs. The smaller increase for 2025 is because inflation is slowing. That means prices aren’t increasing as fast as they were at the height of the COVID pandemic. Recipients got a historically large 8.7% benefit increase in 2023 because of record high inflation . Future problems with the fund have long been predicted, largely because of demographic shifts. As birthrates decline, fewer people become workers, which results in fewer payments of payroll taxes. Meanwhile, more Baby Boomers are retiring and collecting Social Security. The annual Social Security and Medicare trustees report released in May said the program’s trust fund will be unable to pay full benefits beginning in 2035. If the trust fund is depleted, the government will be able to pay only 83% of scheduled benefits, the report said.

        "headline": "The grace period for student loan payments is over. Here’s what you need to know",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — The 12-month grace period for student loan borrowers ended on Sept. 30. The “on-ramp” period helped borrowers who are struggling to make payments avoid the risk of defaulting and hurting their credit score. “The end of the on-ramp period means the beginning of the potentially harsh consequences for student loan borrowers who are not able to make payments,” said Persis Yu, Deputy Executive Director at the Student Borrower Protection Center. Around 43 million Americans have student loan debt, amounting to $1.5 trillion. Around eight million of those borrowers had enrolled in the SAVE plan, the newest income-driven repayment plan that extended the eligibility for borrowers to have affordable monthly student loan payments. However, this plan is currently on hold due to legal challenges. With the on-ramp period and a separate program known as Fresh Start ending and the SAVE plan on hold, student loan borrowers who are struggling to afford their monthly payments have fewer options, added Yu. Student loan borrowers who haven’t been able to afford their monthly payments must consider their options to avoid going into default. If you have student loans, here’s what you need to know.  The Education Department implemented this grace period to ease the borrower’s transition to make payments after a three-year payment pause during the COVID-19 pandemic. During this year-long period, borrowers were encouraged to keep making payments since interest continued to accumulate. “Normally, loans will default if you fall about nine months behind on making payments, but during this on-ramp period, missed payments would not move people towards defaulting and then being subject to forced collections. However, if you missed payments, you still be falling behind ultimately on repaying your loans,” said Abby Shaforth, director of National Consumer Law Center’s Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project. Since this grace period has ended, student loan borrowers who don’t make payments will go delinquent or, if their loans are not paid for nine months, go into default. Borrowers who cannot afford to make payments can apply for deferment or forbearance, which pause payments, though interest continues to accrue. Borrowers who can’t or don’t pay risk delinquency and eventually default. That can badly hurt your credit rating and make you ineligible for additional aid and government benefits. If a borrower missed one month’s payment, they will start receiving email notifications, said Shaforth. Once the loan hasn’t been paid for three months, loan servicers notify to the credit reporting agencies that the loan is delinquent, affecting your credit history. Once the borrower hasn’t paid the loan for nine months, the loan goes into default. If you’re struggling to pay, advisers first encourage you to check if you qualify for an income-driven repayment plan, which determines your payments by looking at your expenses. You can see whether you qualify by visiting the Federal Student Aid website . If you’ve worked for a government agency or a non-profit organization, you could also be eligible for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program , which forgives student debt after 10 years. When you fall behind on a loan by 270 days — roughly 9 months — the loan appears on your credit report as being in default. Once a loan is in default, it goes into collections. This means the government can garnish wages (without a court order) to go towards paying back the loan, intercept tax refunds, and seize portions of Social Security checks and other benefit payments. If your budget doesn’t allow you to resume payments, it’s important to know how to navigate the possibility of default and delinquency on a student loan. Both can hurt your credit rating, which would make you ineligible for additional aid. If you’re in a short-term financial bind, you may qualify for deferment or forbearance — allowing you to temporarily suspend payment. To determine whether deferment or forbearance are good options for you, you can contact your loan servicer. One thing to note: interest still accrues during deferment or forbearance. Both can also impact potential loan forgiveness options. Depending on the conditions of your deferment or forbearance, it may make sense to continue paying the interest during the payment suspension. The U.S. Education Department offers several plans for repaying federal student loans. Under the standard plan, borrowers are charged a fixed monthly amount that ensures all their debt will be repaid after 10 years. But if borrowers have difficulty paying that amount, they can enroll in one of several plans that offer lower monthly payments based on income and family size. Those are known as income-driven repayment plans. Income-driven options have been offered for years and generally cap monthly payments at 10% of a borrower’s discretionary income. If a borrower’s earnings are low enough, their bill is reduced to $0. And after 20 or 25 years, any remaining debt gets erased. In August, the Supreme Court kept on hold the SAVE plan , the income-driven repayment plan that would have lowered payments for millions of borrowers, while lawsuits make their way through lower courts. Eight million borrowers who had already enrolled in the SAVE plan don’t have to pay their monthly student loan bills until the court case is resolved. Debt that already had been forgiven under the plan was unaffected. The next court hearing about this case will be held on Oct. 15. The Fresh Start program, which gave benefits to borrowers who were delinquent prior to the pandemic payment pause, also closed on Sept. 30. During this limited program, student loan borrowers who were in default prior to the pandemic were given the opportunity to remove their loans from default, allowing them to enroll in income-driven payment plans, or apply for deferment, among other benefits. —— “The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — When Mykail James was 19 and working a holiday job at Victoria’s Secret, she took out a store credit card with a $2,000 credit line. When her school break was over, she realized she could no longer afford the payments. After missing a few, she paid off the card only to find that her credit score had decreased dramatically, affecting her ability to access other types of credit. “I didn’t get an actual bank credit card until I was 21, just because of that fear,” said James, who is now a financial expert and creator of The Boujie Budgeter. “Because of how it impacted my credit and also made it harder for me to buy a car a couple of months later.” With holiday shopping season around the corner, experts recommend caution when your favorite store offers you a credit card. “If you’re offered one at the checkout counter, most of the time it makes sense to say no,” said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate. According to the Federal Reserve , outstanding credit card balances reached $1.14 trillion as of August 2024, meaning credit card debt is increasingly a concern for millions of Americans. Bankrate found that the average store-only credit card has an average annual percentage rate of 30.45%, significantly higher than the average APR of 20.78% for all credit cards. The APR is how much interest you’ll be charged if you can’t pay your balance in full every month. Here are recommendations from experts when considering a store credit card: AP correspondent Shelley Adler reports on whether signing up for store credit cards is a good thing. This article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well. Store credit cards are usually offered at checkout, and they provide shoppers with a line of credit that incentivizes spending more on the store’s products. If not managed correctly, these credit cards can negatively impact your credit history. When offered a store credit card, Bruce McClary from the National Foundation for Credit Counseling recommends that you don’t say yes immediately. “Ask for something with all the details in writing that you can take with you and review for a later time,” McClary said. Oftentimes, store credit cards are tied with a promotion such as 0% interest for a year or a discount on your purchase. And while these might sound appealing, it’s best to not rush the decision while you’re at the counter. Before signing up for a store credit card, you must read the fine print, Rossman said, including how much interest will be charged if cards aren’t paid in full and any late or penalty fees. “A lot of times, these retail cards charge tremendously high interest rates,” Rossman said. Another thing to look out for is “deferred interest,” which is when credit cards offer a promotion such as 0% for 12 months but, if the customer doesn’t pay in full by the time the promotion expires, they are charged retroactively for all of the interest that accumulated during that time. If you’re looking to acquire a store credit card, McClary recommends that you do some research on the retailer. Looking at reviews online can help you identify if others have complaints about their store credit cards. Additionally, McClary recommends that you ask yourself these questions: — How often do you shop at the store? — Are you going to be using the card enough to benefit from the rewards and discounts that come with it? — Can you use another type of credit card? — Can you afford to pay the card in full at the end of the month? — How many credit cards do you have? Is it worth adding another line of credit? These questions will help you determine if a store credit card is right for you or if you’d be better off with a different type of credit card. If you decide that a store credit card is a good option, it’s important to pay your card in full each month, McClary said. It’s also a good practice to only spend what you can afford to pay off in one billing cycle, even if your line of credit is higher. “You want to keep yourself from getting into this unmanageable cycle of debt,” McClary said. A tip to build healthy habits is to set specific parameters when using your store credit card, James said. For example, using your store credit card only for purchases over $50. That way you can reduce the amount of money you spend on your credit card and it is easier to keep track of your expenses. Store credit cards were once known as a tool to build your credit history if you’d never had a credit card before. This is because retail credit cards have fewer requirements to get approval. However, in recent years there has been an influx of other credit cards that provide help for people build their credit history, McClary said. If you are looking to build your credit score, McClary recommends you consider secure credit cards. These cards are considered secure because the lender usually asks for a deposit and the line of credit is lower than other credit cards. Once you’ve used secure credit cards and built your credit report, you can graduate to a traditional credit card. Since Buy Now, Pay Later services became available, retail stores have been offering them to customers along with store credit cards. It’s important to understand the differences. Store credit cards work like traditional credit cards. By filling out an application, you request a soft inquiry in your credit report and if you decide to get the credit card, this line of credit will be reflected in your credit score. Buy Now, Pay Later services are not shown in your credit report and they are usually tied to a specific purchase and are not a revolving line of credit. “Companies like Affirm, Afterpay and Klarna have been cutting into the market share of store credit cards because they fill a similar kind of niche,” Rossman said. Both with store credit cards and BNPL services, customers should proceed with caution to avoid getting caught overspending which can lead to great amounts of debt, he added.

        "headline": "What the Fed’s rate cut could mean for you",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — The Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark interest rate from its 23-year high, with consequences for debt, savings, auto loans, mortgages and other forms of borrowing by consumers and businesses. On Wednesday, the Fed announced that it reduced its key rate by an unusually large half-percentage point, to between 4.75 and 5 percent, the first rate cut in more than four years. The central bank is acting because, after imposing 11 rate hikes dating back to March 2022, it feels confident that inflation is finally mild enough that it can begin to ease the cost of borrowing. At the same time, the Fed has grown more concerned about the health of the job market. Lower rates would help support the pace of hiring and keep unemployment down. “Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace,” the Fed said in a statement. “Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low. Inflation has made further progress.” More Fed rate cuts are expected in the coming months, with the steepness of the reductions dependent on the direction of inflation and job growth. “We know that it is time to recalibrate our (interest rate) policy to something that’s more appropriate given the progress on inflation,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference. “The labor market is actually in solid condition and our intention with our policy move today is to keep it there.” “We don’t think we’re behind — we think this is timely,” he added. “But I think you can take this as a sign of our commitment not to get behind.” Although taking action now to try to capitalize on lower rates, like shifting money out of a certificate of deposit or refinancing a mortgage, “might be warranted for some, you shouldn’t feel obligated to completely change up your financial strategy just because rates move lower,” said Jacob Channel, a senior economist at LendingTree. “Act cautiously and responsibly,” Channel said, “and don’t make any rash decisions based on a single Fed meeting or economic report.” Eventually, yields for savers will decline as the Fed lowers its benchmark rate. “As attractive as yields on savings instruments have recently been, it’s wise not to hold too much in cash because these are short-term instruments and their yields are ephemeral,” said Christine Benz, director of personal finance at Morningstar. “The really great yields that we’ve had recently may go lower.” If you don’t have a need for cash right away, you can continue to lock in what are “still pretty decent yields on offer,” she said. In that case, “longer-term certificates of deposit might make sense.” “Lower interest rates make it harder to maximize savings and preserve the capital built while interest rates have been higher,” said Matt Brannon, a personal finance expert at MarketWatch guides. “An easy short-term move to protect your savings is to shift your funds into a high-yield savings account, which offers higher interest rates than traditional savings accounts... These types of savings accounts will still help you to preserve capital due to comparatively higher interest rates.” “While lower rates are certainly a good thing for those struggling with debt, the truth is that this one rate cut isn’t really going to make much of a difference for most people,” said Matt Schulz, a credit analyst at LendingTree. That said, the Fed’s declining benchmark rate will eventually mean better rates for borrowers, many of whom are facing some of the highest credit card interest rates in decades. The average interest rate is 23.18% for new offers and 21.51% for existing accounts, according to WalletHub’s August Credit Card Landscape Report. Still, “the best thing people can do to lower interest rates is to take matters into their own hands,” Schulz said. “Consolidating your debts with a 0% balance transfer credit card or a low-interest personal loan can have a far bigger impact on your debt load than most anything the Fed will do.” The Fed’s benchmark rate doesn’t directly set or correspond to mortgage rates. But it does have a major indirect influence, and the two “tend to move in the same direction,” said LendingTree’s Channel. To wit, mortgage rates have already declined ahead of the Fed’s predicted cut. “It goes to show that even when the Fed isn’t doing anything and just holding steady, mortgage rates can still move,” he said. Channel said that the majority of Americans have mortgages at 5%, so rates may have to fall further than their current average of 6.46% before many people consider refinancing. “With auto loans, it’s good news that rates will be falling, but it doesn’t change the basic blocking and tackling of things, which is that it’s still really important to shop around and not just accept the rate that a car dealer would offer you at the dealership,” said Greg McBride, an analyst at Bankrate. “It’s also really important to save what you can and be able to try to put as much down on that vehicle as you can.” McBride predicts that the rate cuts and the avoidance of a recession will lead to lower auto loan rates, at least for borrowers with strong credit profiles. For those with lower credit profiles, double digit rates will likely persist for the remainder of the year. Robert Frick, corporate economist for Navy Federal Credit Union, said that while he thinks a rate cut will work its way into auto loans, it probably won’t happen immediately and people with higher credit scores will likely benefit first. Loans for new vehicles right now are averaging 7.1%, with used vehicle loans at a much higher 11.3%, according to Edmunds.com. Those rates, coupled with still-high prices, have sent many possible buyers to the sidelines waiting for rates to drop. Partly as a result, U.S. new vehicle sales rose only a sluggish 2.4% through June. High prices and rates have also led to more delinquent payments and defaults on auto loans, especially among people with lower credit scores. As a result, Frick said, many lenders will probably try to keep rates high to cover potential losses. “Rates will be coming down, but we shouldn’t expect them to come down quickly overall,” he said. Frick suggests waiting for additional Fed rate cuts to come through if possible, especially if you’re buying a used vehicle. Jeff Schuster, vice president of automotive research for Global Data, said he doubts that modest rate cuts by the Fed will be enough to draw many buyers off the sidelines, unless automakers offer their own low-interest loans and other discounts. “I think it’s going to take a couple more cuts before we get any substantial relief for those consumers,” he said. Consumer prices rose 2.5% in August from a year earlier, down from 2.9% in July — the fifth straight annual drop and the smallest since February 2021. Hiring picked up a bit in August, and the unemployment rate dipped for the first time since March. Employers added 142,000 jobs, up from 89,000 in July. The unemployment rate declined to 4.2% from 4.3%, which had been the highest level in nearly three years. Those signs indicate that the job market, though cooling, remains sturdy. The rate at which the Fed continues to cut rates after September will depend in part on what happens next with inflation and the job market, in the coming weeks and months.

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Tech behemoth Oracle has agreed to settle a class action lawsuit for $115 million over allegations that it tracked consumer activity both on and offline. The suit alleges Oracle captured, compiled, and sold individuals’ data to third parties without their consent. Oracle maintains its practices were lawful, that it disclosed its activities, and it admitted no wrongdoing. Under the class action settlement, Oracle will pay $115 million to establish a settlement fund, and anyone residing in the United States from August 19, 2018 to the present who was affected may be eligible to file a claim. The fund will also cover up to $28.75 million for attorneys fees and other costs. All valid claimants will receive the same amount of money, which is dependent on how many people file. If you browsed the web, used geolocation services, or made in-store purchases electronically during the six-year period addressed in the settlement, you may be eligible. Allegedly, Oracle Advertising improperly collected personal data from these activities and subsequently sold or made that data available to third parties. The company allegedly did so using Oracle Advertising products including ID Graph and Data Marketplace. “All natural persons residing in the United States whose personal information, or data derived from their personal information, was acquired, captured, or otherwise collected by Oracle Advertising technologies or made available for use or sale by or through ID Graph, Data Marketplace, or any other Oracle Advertising product or service from August 19, 2018 to the date of final judgment in the Action” are eligible, according to the settlement website . The court will decide whether to approve the proposed settlement at a hearing on November 14, 2024.  Claims may be filed online on the official settlement website or by mail. Claims must be filed by October 17, 2024. Shares of Oracle Corp, based in Austin, Texas, rose slightly on Friday. “The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

        "headline": "US consumer watchdog finds that school lunch fees are taking a toll on parents",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Single mother Rebecca Wood, 45, was already dealing with high medical bills in 2020 when she noticed she was being charged a $2.49 “program fee” each time she loaded money onto her daughter’s school lunch account. As more schools turn to cashless payment systems, more districts have contracted with processing companies that charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a new report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The report found that though legally schools must offer a fee-free option to pay by cash or check, there’s rarely transparency around it. “It wouldn’t have been a big deal if I had hundreds of dollars to dump into her account at the beginning of the year,” Wood said. “I didn’t. I was paying as I went, which meant I was paying a fee every time. The $2.50 transaction fee was the price of a lunch. So I’d pay for six lunches, but only get five.” The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the federal policy on fee-free school lunch, has mandated that districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome. “It’s just massively inconvenient,” said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children. Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead.  “A dollar here and there, I expected,” she said. “But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower — as are the salaries — is a lot.” Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day, for two working parents, was an increased burden of time and effort. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free lunches in school, which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point. In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child’s account. For families with lower incomes who can’t afford to load large sums in one go, those fees can hit weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report. In Wood’s case, she researched the fees and learned about the USDA requirement to offer fee-free payment by cash or by check. When she pointed this out to the superintendent of her daughter’s Massachusetts school district, the administrator said the lack of transparency was an oversight. To protest, Wood had planned to pay for her daughter’s lunches in coins at the school office, together with other parents. But then the pandemic hit, changing, among other things, school lunch policy. In subsequent years, Wood became part of a campaign that successfully pushed for universal free school lunches in the state, but she continues to protest school processing fees for families. “Even if lunch itself is free, if you want to buy something a la carte, or an extra lunch, or some other transaction, you still have to pay that fee,” Wood said. “They take money from people who need it the most.” While payment companies maintain that school districts have the chance to negotiate fees and rates when they form their contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures “may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.” Just three companies — MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect — dominate the market, according to the report. Without the ability to choose which company to work with, “families have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices,” the agency said, “including those that may violate federal consumer protection law.” The companies named in the report did not respond to requests for comment. Know that you always have a right to pay by cash or check, under federal policy. You can also request that your school district negotiate down the fees with their payment processing company, or request that the district cover the fees directly, which can give them leverage in negotiating a contract. If your school is located in a low-income area, you may also check whether your district qualifies for the Community Eligibility Provision , which would allow the school to provide free breakfast and lunch to all enrolled students.

        "headline": "Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck may not have had a prenuptial agreement, but you should consider one",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Longtime celebrity watchers may not have been shocked when Jennifer Lopez filed for divorce from Ben Affleck, but what was surprising was that Lopez’s divorce petition did not include any mention of a prenuptial agreement. A prenup is a legal document for soon-to-be-married couples that lays out how they will divide their assets during their marriage and if they divorce. They’re common for celebrities and very wealthy couples, but divorce law attorney Raiford Dalton Palmer says you should consider one even if you don’t have a lot of money . “Prenups are not just for rich people,” said Palmer, who is a managing shareholder of STG Divorce Law. “They can be very important for people that don’t have as much money because every dollar spent on attorney’s fees is a dollar that you’re not able to spend on your children or yourself.” If you plan to get married soon, here’s what you need to know about prenuptial agreements: This article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well. When approaching the topic with your significant other, timing is key. Family law attorney Linda J. Ravdin recommends that you have the conversation sooner rather than later and don’t wait until you’re halfway through organizing your wedding. “As soon as they start talking about marriage, the person who wants the prenup should be saying something,” Ravdin said. It’s also important to be aware of your state’s deadline to submit a prenuptial agreement. For example, California has a seven-day rule, which means that one person needs to present a preliminary prenuptial agreement seven days before the other person can sign it. This is meant to make sure the other person has enough time to review the document.  Talking about prenuptial agreements can be especially difficult since it involves full transparency about your finances. To avoid conflict or hurt feelings, attorney Julia Rodgers recommends approaching the conversation gently. “It’s just as much an emotional document as it is a legal one,” said Rodgers, who is the CEO of Hello Prenup, an online prenuptial agreement platform. Rodgers recommends discussing why you want a prenup and your fears surrounding it. One common reason younger people cite for wanting a prenup is witnessing how difficult their parents’ divorces were. You should discuss what assets you have and how you would divide them if you happen to divorce. This is also the time to have important conversations about expectations during your marriage . Rodgers recommends asking the following questions: — Do you want kids? If so, are both people going to continue working? — If you don’t want kids, what kind of lifestyle do you want? — Do you want to buy a house or rent? — How often do you want to take a long vacation? — What type of debt do you have? — Do you want to open a business in the future? Prenuptial agreements can be equated to estate planning, Palmer said. Couples don’t get married expecting they will divorce, but planning in case it does happen can save them headaches and money. “It’s really appropriate for people that want to make divorce less painful, less expensive and they have property they wish to protect,” Palmer said. With or without a prenuptial agreement, going through a divorce will take lots of time and money. But having a prenup can ease the conversations about the division of property, alimony and debt. However, prenuptial agreements don’t include child support or any other topics related to children. A common misconception about prenups is that they benefit the highest-earning spouse, but this is not true, Rodgers said. Because prenuptial agreements are drafted by both parties, with their respective lawyers, they ideally protect both spouses. Prenuptial agreements are not only useful if the couple divorces. Because they lay out finances and future planning, they can also be used to lay out expectations from both parties during the marriage and in case of death. If you don’t have a prenup, what happens when you divorce will depend on the law in your state. Every state has default laws that establish how the division of property is handled in divorces. These laws typically try to divide the assets equally, but that’s not always the case, Palmer said. Any debt or new property acquired during the marriage would also be divided according to state law. “If you take on student loan debt during your marriage, that student loan debt could be considered marital or community property, depending on what state you’re in,” Rodgers said. In some states, like California, if a couple doesn’t have a prenuptial agreement, they are required to divide their assets in half. In other states, such as Iowa and Colorado, the distribution will be proportional but not equal. Oftentimes in these states, aspects like earning potential and financial needs are considered. Once you’re ready to start drafting a prenup, you each need a lawyer to help you write or review it. Ravdin first asks clients to fill out a worksheet where they can lay down what they’re looking for in the prenuptial agreement and use this as a blueprint for the draft. “If it’s clear what they want or what’s acceptable to both of them, I can go ahead and draft the agreement,” Ravdin said. The price of the prenuptial agreements process depends on your state and your attorney. In many cases, prenuptial agreements start from $1,000.

        "headline": "How to prepare for the Fed’s forthcoming interest rate cuts",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — The Federal Reserve is poised to cut its benchmark interest rate next month from its 23-year high, with consequences for consumers when it comes to debt, savings, auto loans and mortgages. Right now, most experts envision three quarter-point Fed cuts — in September, November and December — though even steeper rate cuts are possible. “The time has come” for the Fed to reduce interest rates, Powell said Friday in his keynote speech at the Fed’s annual economic conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming . “The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.” Based on Powell’s remarks and recent economic data, the central bank is expected to cut its key rate by a quarter-point when it meets next month and to carry out additional rate cuts in the coming months. Here’s what consumers should know: According to Greg McBride, chief credit analyst for Bankrate, savers should lock in attractive yields right now, before the expected rate cuts begin. “For those who might be looking at Certificates of Deposit or bonds — you want to jump on that now,” he said. “There is not a benefit to waiting because interest rates are going to be moving lower.” McBride stressed that anyone closer to retirement has a good opportunity to lock in CDs at the current relatively high rates. “If you do so, you’ll provide yourself a predictable flow of interest income at rates that should outpace inflation by a pretty healthy margin,” said McBride.  “Your credit card bill is not going to plunge the day after the next Fed meeting,” cautions LendingTree chief credit analyst Matt Schulz. “Nobody should expect miracles.” That said, the declining benchmark rate will eventually mean better rates for borrowers, many of whom are facing some of the highest credit card interest rates in decades. The average interest rate is 23.18% for new offers and 21.51% for existing accounts, according to WalletHub’s August Credit Card Landscape Report. Still, “it’s really important for people to understand that rates probably aren’t going to fall that quickly,” Schulz said. He said it’s important to take steps such as seeking a 0% interest balance transfer or a low-interest personal loan. You can also call your credit card issuer to see if you can negotiate a better rate. “In the short term, those things will have a much bigger effect than falling interest rates,” Schulz said. The Federal Reserve’s benchmark rate doesn’t directly set or correspond to mortgage rates, but it does have an influence, and the two “tend to move in the same direction,” said LendingTree senior economist Jacob Channel. In recent weeks, mortgage rates have already declined ahead of the Fed’s predicted cut, he pointed out. “It goes to show that even when the Fed isn’t doing anything and just holding steady, mortgage rates can still move,” Channel said. Melissa Cohn, the regional vice president of William Raveis Mortgage, echoed this, saying that the most important thing is what signal the Fed is sending to the market, rather than the rate change itself. “I’ve heard from a lot of people who locked in (their mortgage rate) over the course of the past 18 months, when rates were at their peak, already asking whether it’s time to refinance and what savings they could have,” she said. “I think that the outlook is good, and hopefully that spills into the real estate market, and we get more buyers in the market.” Channel said that the majority of Americans have mortgages at 5%, so rates may have to fall further than their current average of 6.46% before many people consider refinancing. “With auto loans, it’s good news that rates will be falling, but it doesn’t change the basic blocking and tackling of things, which is that it’s still really important to shop around and not just accept the rate that a car dealer would offer you at the dealership,” said Bankrate’s McBride. “It’s also really important to save what you can and be able to try to put as much down on that vehicle as you can.” McBride does predict that the beginning of rate cuts and the avoidance of a recession will lead to lower auto loan rates in 2024 — at least for borrowers with strong credit profiles. For those with lower credit profiles, double digit rates will likely persist for the remainder of the year. Last week, the government reported that consumer prices rose just 2.9% in July from a year ago, the smallest increase in over three years. Employment data, however, gives some economists pause. New data has showed hiring in July was much less than expected and the jobless rate has reached 4.3% , the highest in three years — one measure of a weakening economy. That said, robust retail sales have helped quell fears of a recession. The rate at which the Fed continues to cut rates after September will depend in part on what happens next with inflation and the job market, in the coming weeks and months.

        "headline": "Wrongful death suit against Disney serves as a warning to consumers when clicking ‘I agree’",
        "content": "A wrongful death lawsuit against Walt Disney Parks and Resorts is serving as a reminder to consumers of the importance of reading the fine print when signing up for a streaming service or smartphone app. The lawsuit was filed by the family of a New York woman who died after eating at a restaurant in Disney Springs, an outdoor dining, shopping and entertainment complex in Florida owned by Disney. Disney is arguing that the lawsuit should be dropped because the plaintiff, the woman’s husband, once signed up for a trial subscription of the Disney+ streaming service. That service, they argue, includes a subscriber agreement in which the customer agrees to settle any lawsuits against Disney out of court through arbitration. Such agreements, which customers quickly consent to by clicking “I agree” when downloading an app or a streaming service, are so stacked against the consumer that it’s often difficult to offer good legal advice, said John Davisson, director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “The consumer is presented with this contract and really doesn’t have an opportunity to negotiate the terms,” Davisson said. “It’s yes or no.”  Kanokporn Tangsuan’s family says in the lawsuit that the 42-year-old New York doctor had a fatal allergic reaction after eating at an Irish pub in Disney Springs. The lawsuit claims Tangsuan and her husband, Jeffrey Piccolo, and his mother decided to eat at Raglan Road in October 2023 because it was billed on Disney’s website as having “allergen free food.” The suit alleges Tangsuan informed their server numerous times that she had a severe allergy to nuts and dairy products, and that the waiter “guaranteed” the food was allergen-free. About 45 minutes after finishing their dinner, Tangsuan had difficulty breathing while out shopping, collapsed and died at a hospital, according to the lawsuit. A medical examiner determined she died as a result of “anaphylaxis due to elevated levels of dairy and nut in her system,” the lawsuit said. Disney said in a statement this week that it is “deeply saddened” by the family’s loss but stressed that the Irish pub, which also is being sued, is neither owned nor operated by the company. More notably from a consumer protection standpoint, Disney argues that Piccolo had agreed to settle any lawsuits against Disney out of court through arbitration when he signed up for a one-month trial of Disney+ in 2019 and acknowledged that he had reviewed the fine print. “The first page of the Subscriber Agreement states, in all capital letters, that ‘any dispute between You and Us, Except for Small Claims, is subject to a class action waiver and must be resolved by individual binding arbitration’,” the company wrote in a motion seeking to have the case dismissed. Arbitration allows people to settle disputes without going to court and generally involves a neutral arbitrator who reviews arguments and evidence before making a binding decision, or award. Piccolo’s lawyer, in a response filed this month, argued that it was “absurd” to believe that the more than 150 million subscribers to Disney+ have waived all rights to sue the company and its affiliates in perpetuity — especially when their case has nothing to do with the popular streaming service. While it’s difficult to give consumers actionable advice when such agreements are so lopsided in favor of companies, Davisson suggested supporting lawmakers and regulators who are attentive to these issues. The Federal Trade Commission has historically supported the idea of disclosure terms protecting companies, even though the agreements are often dense and hard for typical consumers to comprehend. But Davisson says there has been a shift among policymakers and federal regulators. “Generally, it’s understood that it is literally impossible for consumers to read and interpret and fully understand all of the contracts that they’re being asked and expected by the law to agree to and abide by as they go about their day,” he said. “Especially in an increasingly online world in which we’re interacting with dozens or hundreds of platforms and services a day.” Lewis reported from New York and Murphy from Oklahoma City."

        "headline": "Groceries are expensive, but they don’t have to break the bank. Here are some tips to save",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — If you’ve noticed that you’re paying more than before for the same amount of groceries, you’re not the only one. Inflation is easing , but grocery prices are still high — up 21%, on average, since inflation started to surge more than three years ago. Unlike some other items, you can’t just stop buying groceries when they get pricey. There’s nothing you can do about inflation, but you can find ways to save on groceries so they don’t heavily affect your wallet or your eating habits. These include using coupons, budgeting and buying in bulk. Here’s are some expert recommendations for saving on groceries: Kiersten Torok started using coupons back when she was in high school, after her parents lost their jobs during the 2008 recession. She began relying on them even more in 2020, when she lost her own job during the pandemic. Now she’s using her social media platform to help others learn how to save. “When times like these come up, coupons are a necessity for so many Americans,” said Torok, known on Instagram and TikTok as Torok Coupon Hunter . Many might think that using coupons means cutting them out of a magazine. While you can certainly still do that, there are now easier ways to get the discounts. Many stores, like Walmart and Target, have coupons available on their apps. “All you have to do is scan an item in a store, the coupons pop up on your app and then they automatically apply in the register,” Torok said. “It’s become much more streamlined.” This article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well. One of Torok’s coupon golden rules is: Never pay big for toothpaste — there’s always a combination of coupons and offers available. For anyone who wants to try couponing, Torok recommends that you first start using them at your favorite store and never buy things you don’t need, even if there’s a big discount. Apps like Flipp , which lets you browse for coupons from all major grocery stores, and Ibotta , an app that gives you cashback for using coupons, can make your journey with couponing easier. Making a budget is a key to keeping grocery spending under control, and the first step is to track how much you’re already spending. Start by reviewing how much you have spent on the last few times you’ve gone grocery shopping, recommended David Brindley, deputy editor for AARP Bulletin . If you don’t keep receipts from past grocery runs, try looking at your bank account statement and adding up the grocery charges. Once you know how much you spend on groceries, set a goal, for example, staying within a specific budget or reducing your spending. You need a plan, but before you make one, ensure you know what you currently have in your fridge and your pantry. Sarah Schweisthal, personal finance expert and social media manager at budgeting app YNAB , recommends taking everything out and making an inventory so you don’t buy duplicates of things you already have on hand. Brindley also recommends planning to cook multiple meals with similar ingredients, which saves money and also cuts down on food waste. Once you’ve tracked your spending and inventoried what you already have, the next step is to make a plan. Write down the items you’re looking to buy and your estimated cost, making sure you stay on budget. Meal planning for the week or month can be a good way to stay on top of your spending, Schweisthal said. Going up and down the aisles can sometimes make you crave things that you haven’t planned for, like a snack or a new dish. If you foresee that it’ll be hard for you to stick to your list, include some flexibility in your plan, such as allotting a specific amount to buy snacks or a random item you see at the checkout line. “I think having flexibility in a plan actually helps you stick to it more,” Schweisthal said. Making a plan can be as simple as writing down a list on paper or in your phone’s notes app. Or, you can use apps that specifically help you with meal planning such as AnyList or Mealime . If you tend to wander off your grocery list because every time you go to the store you buy things you don’t need, shopping online and picking up curbside is a good workaround. “I 100% recommend sitting down Sunday morning and just looking at the stores and comparing the items you need for the week, especially with things you can get for curbside pickup,” Torok said. If you buy your groceries from multiple stores because each has better prices on some items, ordering ahead of time can also save time. If you are in charge of buying groceries for your entire family, it can be beneficial to include them in your grocery budgeting routine. For Torok, this has meant teaching her children how to scan coupons while they shop. Since buying in bulk can be very cost-effective. Brindley also recommends that you team up with a friend or a family member to buy specific items in bulk and share the discount. Lastly, you can save money by using food-sharing apps such as Olio, which connects people around their community to share extra grocery items, and Too Good to Go, where you can buy surplus food at a discount.

        "headline": "How to get relief from unexpectedly high medical bills",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Unexpectedly high medical bills are common in the United States , but there are ways to get relief. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, one in five Americans are affected by outstanding medical debt, for a total cost of $88 billion. In a 2022 study, the bureau found that roughly 20% of U.S. households report that they have medical debt, with collections appearing on 43 million credit reports. As of the second quarter of 2021, 58% of all bills in collections on credit records were medical bills. Medical debt affects households unevenly, too, according to the agency. Past-due bills are more prevalent among Black and Hispanic people than white and Asian people, and medical debt is more common in the Southern U.S., in part because states in that region did not expand Medicaid coverage. While the process of fighting high medical bills can be time-consuming and frustrating, advocates stress that patients shouldn’t be intimidated by the system. If you’ve received a surprise medical bill, here’s what you should know : This article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well. When Luisa, 33, received a medical bill for over $1,000 after an emergency hospital visit for a viral infection, she was able to have the whole amount covered by the hospital after appealing to their financial assistance policy. “At first I thought it was just a cold, but it turned out to be something I needed specific medication for,” said Luisa, who asked to be identified only by her first name due to privacy concerns. “It was really bad by the time I went to the ER.” Luisa had heard about the patient advocacy organization Dollar For thanks to a viral video, and she filled out the nonprofit’s online form after receiving her surprise bill. The organization contacted the hospital, which was based in central Florida. Eventually, the hospital contacted Luisa directly to let her know she did in fact qualify for financial assistance. Even though she had already paid a portion of the costs with a credit card, Dollar For was able to get those payments refunded.  Laws governing hospital charity care require that nonprofit hospitals lower or write off bills for individuals, depending on household income. To determine if you qualify, you can simply Google the hospital along with the phrase “charity care” or “financial assistance policy.” Dollar For also provides a simplified online tool for patients to see if they qualify. “Federal law requires hospitals to have these programs to keep their tax-exempt status,” said Jared Walker, CEO of Dollar For. “If you’re within their income range, they will write off, waive, forgive, or reduce your bills.” Even if you’ve already been paying off medical debt, the hospital will be required to refund the payments you’ve made, he said. “It was my first time going through something like that,” Luisa said. “I tried to be an informed consumer and ask questions when I was in the hospital about the costs, but obviously it’s hard when you’re sick in the emergency room.” While protections against surprise bills have long existed for those who have Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare, laws are now also in place for those with private or marketplace insurance. The federal No Surprises Act covers people who have insurance through their employers, the marketplace, or individual plans. It says that insurance companies must reasonably cover any out-of-network services related to emergency and some non-emergency medical care. That means that if you’re being charged more than you’re used to or expect when you receive in-network services, that bill may be illegal. To challenge any bill covered under this law, you can use the free help desk and hotline of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services . Many states also have free consumer assistance programs to help with disputes and insurance questions. You can always contact the medical billing department of any hospital in writing to say that you believe a bill is in violation of the No Surprises Act and ask the hospital to deal directly with your insurance company. “The complexity of the system itself is as big a problem as affordability,” said Kaye Pastaina, who heads research on patient protections for KFF, a nonprofit health policy organization. “A lot of it is from the fragmented system and complex rules, but also lack of awareness about existing protections that are a part of federal law that might help.” Even if you don’t qualify for charity care or you’re not sure your bills are covered by the No Surprises Act, you may be able to reduce the charges. Medical billing is notoriously byzantine and rife with errors. Anytime you receive a bill, ask the hospital or healthcare provider for an itemized bill that includes the billing codes of all the care you received. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) mandates that providers share this information. Next, check whether the billing codes are accurate. Again, simply Googling the codes with the phrase “medical billing code” can help. If something is off, contesting your bill with your medical provider or physician’s office can yield changes. Another approach: comparing the bill with insurance companies’ estimates of fair charges for services. If the price you were charged is more than average, you can have your costs lowered. You could even take the provider to small claims court over the discrepancy (or let them know you have a case). Finally, compare your insurance company’s “explanation of benefits” to the bill. This explanation of costs covered and not covered must match the hospital’s bill. If they don’t, you have another reason not to pay, and to ask the provider to work with your insurance company further first. Despite the hassle, these steps can save you considerable sums of money. Even after taking these steps, you can always appeal health claims with your insurance company, if you think there is any reason the bills should be covered entirely or more than the company initially decided. You can also contact your state insurance commissioner for support. “What we’ve seen in our research and the data is that those folks who appeal — and there are few who appeal — but for those who appeal, there’s a high level of overturning,” Pastaina said.

        "headline": "What investors should do when there is more volatility in the market",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are bouncing back after the market experienced its worst day in two years on Monday , but the average investor may still be understandably spooked. Over a three day losing streak, the S&P 500 dipped more than 6% before rallying again Tuesday, up 1.6% in midday trading. “This is what an emotion-driven market looks like,” said Mark Hackett, head of investment research for Nationwide. “You had a three day period that was really very challenging. But the drop was not justified by the data that was out there, which is why you then have a day like today.” For everyday people, what are the best ways to handle market volatility? The top advice is to do nothing, but ultimately your response depends in part on your circumstances and financial goals. “It’s important to remember that investing in the stock market is a long game. There’s going to be volatility, so be wary of having a knee-jerk reaction and pulling your money out at the first sign of a drop,” said Courtney Alev, consumer advocate for CreditKarma. “Selling stocks frequently or incrementally can come with fees for each transaction and those can add up fast.” Caleb Silver, editor in chief of Investopedia, echoed this, cautioning that sellers may also end up owing taxes on any gains. “For everyday investors, volatility is the price you pay to be invested in the stock market,” Silver said. “But it’s very unsettling when we see big market drops of two to three percent… It’s a little unnerving for people who have their money in 401(k)’s or IRA’s or retirement funds to watch this magnitude of volatility.” Silver urged investors to remember that “a market falls into a correction, ten percent or more, once a year on average,” and that “usually the market reverts to the mean, and the mean is an average annual return of eight to ten percent a year going all the way back to the 1950s.” For younger people just beginning to invest, declines in the stock market are an opportunity to add to your portfolio at cheaper prices, by buying in when the market is falling or has fallen a lot, according to Silver. “You’re reducing the average price you pay for the securities, stocks, mutual funds, or index funds that you own (when you buy in a down market),” he said. “So when the market itself reverts to the mean and rises again, you take advantage of having bought at cheaper prices, and that adds to the value of your portfolio.” In terms of selling, though, he said the best advice for most investors is to do nothing and wait for the volatility to cool down. “Whenever you invest in stocks it’s important to be mindful of your time horizon,” said Alev. “For instance, do you expect you’ll need to liquidate in the near future? In that case, you’re likely better off opting for a less volatile and more risk-averse mode of growing your money, such as a high-yield savings account.” Silver agreed. “I don’t believe it when people say, ‘Don’t look at your 401(k),’” he said. “You should absolutely look and see what you own and see that it matches your risk appetite.” If it doesn’t, you can move your investments to products that can shield you from the ups and downs of the market or unforeseen events. Silver said that High Yield Savings Accounts, Certificates of Deposit, and money market accounts are all currently seeing returns of about 4% to 5% for the more cautious or conservative investor. Nationwide’s Hackett said it makes sense to periodically rebalance the exposure one has in their portfolio in general - whether quarterly or annually - to make sure there isn’t more risk than one would want related to, say, technology stocks or another sector. “If your exposures get out of line with your long-term plan, get them back in line,” he said. Even so, Hackett added that he sees the trend of tech stocks outperforming as one that may extend further into the future. Experts agree that, for investors with debt, it’s important to focus on paying off loans, especially high-interest ones, before making major investments. That said, “if you are able to simultaneously pay off your loans and invest a little bit at the same time, you are effectively paying your future self for being responsible about your debt while growing your investments over time,” Silver said.

        "headline": "Stores lure back-to-school shoppers with deals and ‘buy now, pay later’ plans",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Mass market retailers in the U.S. are plying shoppers with offers for computers, clothes and other back-to-school essentials at affordable prices. To seal the deal, they are marketing “buy now, pay later” services as a way for customers to spread out the cost of going back to class in style. The strategies for securing sales are on display to coax consumers, particularly those in lower income brackets, into spending during the retail world’s second-most important period behind the winter holidays, retailers and analysts said. Various forecasts project back-to-school sales this year will be about the same or lower than last year. Even as inflation has come down, the costs of food, rent and other necessities remain much higher than before the coronavirus pandemic . High interest rates have made it more expensive to carry a credit card balance. Savvy shoppers across the income spectrum have proven willing to shop second-hand and to buy store labels and brands , which are typically cheaper than nationally advertised brands. “Inflation is the main thing dictating the change in my spending,” Jasleen Reyes, 43, a mother of three who works as a hotel operations manager and lives in New York City’s Harlem neighborhood, said. “Before it wasn’t so bad. Now, I have to watch every dollar.” For Reyes, that means looking for more discounts, particularly when it comes to getting sneakers and jeans for her children. She also planned to use a “buy now, pay later,” or BNPL, plan to buy a laptop for her 24-year-old son, a college student, and school uniforms for one of her teenage daughters.  Reyes estimates she will spend $3,200-$3,400 on back-to-school items this year, about $1,500 more than last year mainly because of the laptop. She uses credit cards but prefers the four installment BNPL option because it splits up her costs over two months, interest-free, instead of adding them to a monthly bill that would accrue interest if she were unable to pay off the balance right away. Unlike gifting holidays such as Christmas and Valentine’s Day, the back-to-school period is dominated by spending on essentials like class supplies and replacing clothes and shoes that kids have outgrown. But like the winter holidays , the back-to-school shopping season keeps starting earlier. One reason is Amazon’s Prime Day. Rivals hoping to capture some of the online behemoth’s momentum have helped make July a good month for discounts. Target, for example, offered 20 school supplies, including notebooks and colored pencils, that together cost less than $20. The discount retailer moved the sale to the third week of June from the first week of July a year ago. More people are using “buy now, pay later” services heading into the back-to-school season. In June, $6.75 billion worth of online purchases in the U.S. were made with BNPL services, a 14.3% increase from the same month a year ago, according to Adobe Analytics data. Many shoppers appreciate the flexibility of “buy now, pay later,” but consumer advocates have expressed concerns that the growth of the payment method may reflect financial stress and ultimately leave Americans in more debt. BNPL company Afterpay said millennials made a majority of the back-to-school-related purchases on the platform from April through June, followed by members of Generation X. Spending for back-to-school products grew across “accessories, apparel, electronics, footwear and home furnishings,” a company spokesperson said. Afterpay data from May, June and July show a 65% year-over-year increase in backpack sales made through the company’s payment system, while sales of flashcards and electronic tablets grew by more than 50%. Sales of “school shorts,” “school skirts” and low-top sneakers purchased through Afterpay increased more than 100%. The National Retail Federation forecasts back-to-school sales will reach $38.8 billion this year, the second-highest figure since the group started recording the figures in 2007. Last year’s $41.5 billion still holds the record. “Households are dealing with inflation right now,” Jack Kleinhentz, the federation’s chief economist, said during a media briefing last week. “Even though it’s improving, they have to prioritize. They have to be more selective.” Professional services and consulting company Deloitte estimates back-to-school spending will reach $31.3 billion, essentially unchanged from $31.9 billion a year ago. Back-to-school shopping contributed to the record sales that Amazon reported from its 10th Prime Day event on July 16-17, with big spikes in spending for products such as backpacks, lunchboxes and stationary supplies, Adobe said. The tech company does not adjust its analytics data for inflation but said new demand, not higher prices, have fueled most increases in consumer spending this year. Chummy Tees, an online T-shirt company based in Sonora, California, has been running more deals compared with a year ago, founder Josh Neuman said. He said the shopping frenzy kicked off in late June; last year, business picked up in mid-July and intensified in August, Neuman said. “Seems like parents want to get ahead of the game to score the best deals and make sure their kids are set for the first day,” he said. For the back-to-college crowd, dorm supplies e-tailer Dormify is playing to both ends of the budget, according to co-founder Amanda Zuckerman. This season, Dormify created two different bundles, one for big spenders and one for customers on a budget. The 16-piece deluxe bundle starts at $329, while the “core” bundle starts at $199 and includes 27 items. The retailer also has lowered the starting prices for some items. For example, comforters start at $69, $30 lower than a year ago. Zuckerman said back-to-college spending, which usually kicks off in late May, kicked off this month. She thinks the late spending was due to the delays and glitches with the government’s Free Application for Federal Student Aid approval process after an updated version of the financial aid form was released.

        "headline": "US agency says apps that let workers access paychecks before payday are providing loans",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said Thursday that apps that allow workers to access their paychecks in advance , often for a fee, are providing loans and therefore subject to the Truth in Lending Act, a 1968 law that requires lenders disclose all loan costs and fees. If enacted, the proposed rule would provide clarity to a fast-growing industry known as Earned Wage Access, which has been compared to payday lending. The agency wants borrowers to be able to “easily compare products” and to prevent “race-to-the-bottom business practices,” CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said on a call with reporters. Earned Wage Access apps have been around for more than a decade, but they gained popularity in the years prior to the pandemic and since. The apps extend small short-term loans to workers in between paychecks so they can pay bills and meet everyday needs. On payday, the user repays the money out of their wages, along with any fees. According to its report, the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau found that, in 2022, at least 5% of American workers used an earned wage product at least once. They estimate that 7 million workers were advanced $22 billion through apps that worked with their employers, and 3 million workers were advanced $9.1 billion through direct-to-consumer apps. The agency’s research shows the average worker who uses Earned Wage Access takes out 27 of these loans a year, meaning one loan for almost every biweekly paycheck. This can look similar to a revolving credit card balance. But with fees that would equal an average Annual Percentage Rate (APR) of over 100%, the loans have interest rates higher than the most expensive subprime credit card. Most of this interest comes from fees to expedite access to paychecks, the CFPB found.  The typical user of these apps earns also less than $50,000 a year, according to the Government Accountability Office, and has experienced the pinch of two years of high inflation . Many of the apps charge monthly subscription fees and most charge mandatory fees for instant transfers of funds. Christine Zinner, policy counsel at Americans for Financial Reform, said the paycheck advance products “are nothing more than workplace payday loans, with consumers (being) more easily preyed upon since the money is only a tap away on a cell phone.” “People can easily become trapped in a cycle of debt by re-borrowing, requesting advances 12 to 120 times each year, just to pay basic household expenses and make ends meet,” she said. The CFPB also said it is paying close attention to the “tips” many of the apps request when providing advances on paychecks. On the call, Chopra called the practice odd, noting that many paycheck advance companies bring in “substantial revenues” from the so-called tips. In 2021, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation found “users often feel compelled to leave (tips) due to applied pressure tactics like... claiming tips are used to support other vulnerable consumers or for charitable purposes.” With the interpretive rule, the CFPB is clarifying that “if workers obtain money they are required to repay out of their paychecks, this is a loan under federal law, (and the companies) must disclose an interest rate.” This means that tips and fees for expedited transfers must be incorporated into the cost of the loan, under the disclosure scheme mandated by the Truth in Lending Act, and those costs may not be treated as “incidental, even if the amount is variable,” Chopra said. Some Earned Wage Access companies have argued these fees should not be treated as part of the standard APR calculation on the loans. When Connecticut passed a law capping the fees the apps could charge under its state usury limits, at least one Earned Wage Access company, EarnIn, stopped operating in the state. Asked why, EarnIn CEO Ram Palaniappan said it was no longer “economically viable.” Penny Lee, president of the Financial Technology Association, an industry group that counts many EWA companies as members, said her group is “deeply concerned” by the proposed action by the CFPB. “Earned Wage Access should not be considered a loan as it is a no-cost, non-recourse product giving access to money workers have already earned, not future pay,” she said in a prepared statement, adding the proposed rule would “hurt millions of workers who rely on Earned Wage Access to tap into their already earned wages.” In its report, the CFPB found that, despite companies marketing these services as free for workers in non-employer subsidized transactions, “most workers paid at least one fee and nearly all workers opt to pay a fee for expedited access to their funds.” The CFPB said that with nearly 50% of earned wage product users turning to the service more than once a month, “costs may accumulate for workers who are frequently paid by the hour, have liquidity constraints, and receive public benefits.” The agency will take comments on the proposed interpretive rule until the end of August. “Today’s report and rule are important steps for the CFPB to ensure the market is working,” Chopra said. “We want to see the market compete down costs for employees and employers.” The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

        "headline": "Amazon Prime Day deals are almost here. Should you take advantage of them?",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — It’s summertime, and the bargains seem easy at a time when many consumer prices are high. July sales events have become a seasonal revenue driver for the retail industry since Amazon launched its first Prime Day back in 2015. While consumers may be enticed by the advertised can’t-miss savings on some products, personal finance experts say shoppers should be careful not to fall for potentially misleading marketing or give in to impulse buys. Amazon has drummed up expectations in recent weeks for its 10th Prime Day event , which will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday and is open only to customers who pay $14.99 per month, or $139 per year, to receive free shipping and other perks as Prime members . Rival retailers tried in the past to capture some of the Prime Day excitement by offering their own discounts during the two-day event. This year, Walmart, Target, Kohl’s, and newcomers TikTok Shop and Temu launched summer promotions ahead of Amazon, hoping to siphon off some of the e-commerce giant’s savings-hungry shoppers. Meanwhile, Macy’s will be rolling out what it calls its “best summer deals” during an eight-day discount event that begins on Tuesday.  July sales help retailers attract customers who are looking to get a head start on back-to-school shopping, which is the industry’s second-most important shopping season behind the winter holiday period. The markdowns also pull in some discretionary spending from shoppers who’ve had their eyes on gadgets, household products and seasonal items , such as a bikini or a new summer dress. Discounts can help retailers combat “a summer lull in retail spending” as consumers shift their spending to summer vacations and services, like going out to eat at restaurants, according to John Mercer, the head of global research at Coresight Research. “It drives a bit of excitement in that mid-year period,” when retailers may otherwise struggle to generate more revenue, Mercer said. Companies also have relied on discounts to drive consumer spending during the recent period of inflation and high interest rates, he said. Amazon doesn’t disclose how much revenue it pulls in from Prime Day, but it has given some indications of its success. The company said last year’s event resulted in the “single largest sales day” in the company’s history, with customers purchasing more than 375 million items. An estimate from market research firm Emarketer indicated Amazon’s global sales on Prime Day went up to $12.5 billion in 2023. The firm forecasts sales to jump roughly 7% this year. It depends on who you ask. Retailers hype up their promotions to pull people in. But the New York Times-owned product review website Wirecutter published an article this month saying most of Amazon’s early deals this year so far “stink.” Santa Clara University business professor Kirthi Kalyanam, who is writing a book about Amazon, said Prime Day offers have been good, historically. That’s because the company was able to source discounts from well-known brands such as Apple and to incentivize third-party sellers to lower their prices by promising to feature them prominently on the Amazon website, according to Kalyanam. But Prime Day discounts may matter less these days because customers are getting accustomed to the ultra-cheap products sold by Amazon competitors Shein and Temu , which were both founded in China. “Many of (the) deals may not be as competitive compared to Temu and Shein,” Kalyanam said. At the same time, he noted rival retailers will most likely be looking at Amazon’s prices and trying to match them overnight. Last week, he said he saw Best Buy discount two products after Amazon revealed some of its early deals. Consumer data company Numerator reported that a majority of the roughly 5,000 Prime Day shoppers it surveyed after last year’s event saw product discounts of up to 40%. Survey respondents said they saw a quarter of items selling at a discount of 60% or more. Some shopping experts have said that some past Prime discounts were not as big as they appeared. If you’re watching your budget , personal finance experts say you should exercise caution before you buy. “Avoid the false sense of urgency of manufactured holidays,” advises Mark Elliot, chief customer officer at financial services company LendingClub. “The idea that ‘The more you spend, the more you save’ — that’s just definitionally not true.” Dan Egan, a vice president at financial advising and investment company Betterment, says shoppers should make a list of what they need before the sales begin to be intentional about purchases. He also encourages consumers to avoid shopping late at night or out of boredom. “Once you have a list, it’s less likely you’ll get distracted by things you don’t need,” Egan said. “If that list contains almost nothing, I would say to delete the (retailers’) apps off your phone for the next week or two. Or you’re going to get lots of notifications.” Any shopper already carrying a credit card balance should keep in mind that the interest paid on that balance could end up cancelling out any perceived savings from a summer sale purchase, he added. “A deal is not a deal if you have to pay interest on it,” Egan said. While it may make sense for shoppers to try out free or temporary memberships to qualify for the best deals during the summer sales, those programs typically charge a fee to the customer’s credit card on file after a short period of time, noted Erin Witte, the Consumer Federation of America’s director of consumer protection. “Set a calendar reminder to cancel if you don’t want to go through with that subscription,” Witte said. “Think about it right at the beginning. And remember that these companies design this product to make it easy to sign up, but more difficult to cancel.” Consumer Reports also offers a few tips: Download Amazon’s app, sign-up for invite-only deals available for a select group of shoppers, and join the waitlist on limited-time offers that are already sold out. Filling up an online Amazon cart is tempting for Prime members since they are paying for access to Prime Day deals. But it’s always a smart idea to compare prices across multiple websites before completing a purchase. Unlike Prime Day offers, Walmart’s discount event this month was open to everyone. However, the company sweetened the deal for its Walmart+ members by offering them early access. Target only offered discounts to shoppers enrolled in its Target Circle loyalty program and used the weeklong event to promote a new membership program that aims to rejuvenate sales and traffic. TikTok Shop, the e-commerce arm of the popular video-sharing app , opened its summer sales event to everyone. The event started on July 9 and runs until Wednesday.

        "headline": "Groceries are expensive, but they don’t have to break the bank. Here are some tips to save",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — If you’ve noticed that you’re paying more than before for the same amount of groceries, you’re not the only one. Inflation is easing slightly , but grocery prices are still high — up 21% on average since inflation started to surge more than three years ago. “When inflation rises, it reduces people’s ability to afford groceries by increasing the overall cost of goods,” said Cassandra Happe, analyst for WalletHub. Unlike some other items, you can’t just stop buying groceries when they get pricey. There’s nothing you can do about inflation, but you can find ways to save on groceries so they don’t heavily impact your wallet or your eating habits. These include using coupons, budgeting, and buying in bulk. Here’s are some expert recommendations for saving on groceries: Kiersten Torok started using coupons back when she was in high school, after her parents lost their jobs during the 2008 recession. She began relying on them even more in 2020, when she lost her own job during the pandemic. Now she’s using her social media platform to help others learn how to save. “When times like these come up, coupons are a necessity for so many Americans,” said Torok, known on Instagram and TikTok as Torok Coupon Hunter . Many might think that using coupons means cutting them out of a magazine. While you can certainly still do that, there are now easier ways to get the discounts. Many stores, like Walmart and Target, have coupons available on their apps. This article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well. “All you have to do is scan an item in a store, the coupons pop up on your app and then they automatically apply in the register,” Torok said. “It’s become much more streamlined.”  One of Torok’s coupon golden rules is: never pay for toothpaste — there’s always a combination of coupons and offers available. For anyone who wants to try couponing, Torok recommends that you first start using them at your favorite store and never buy things you don’t need, even if there’s a big discount. Apps like Flipp , which lets you browse for coupons from all major grocery stores, and Ibotta , an app that gives you cashback for using coupons, can make your journey with couponing easier. Making a budget is a key to keeping grocery spending under control, and the first step is to track how much you’re already spending. Start by reviewing how much you have spent on the last few times you’ve gone grocery shopping, recommended David Brindley, deputy editor for AARP Bulletin . If you don’t keep receipts from past grocery runs, try looking at your bank account statement and adding up the grocery charges. Once you know how much you spend on groceries , set a goal, for example, staying within a specific budget or reducing your spending.  You need a plan, but before you make one, ensure you know what you currently have in your fridge and your pantry. Sarah Schweisthal, personal finance expert and social media manager at budgeting app YNAB , recommends taking everything out and making an inventory so you don’t buy duplicates of things you already have on hand. Brindley also recommends planning to cook multiple meals with similar ingredients, which saves money and also cuts down on food waste. Once you’ve tracked your spending and inventoried what you already have, the next step is to make a plan. Write down the items you’re looking to buy and your estimated cost, making sure you stay on budget. Meal planning for the week or month can be a good way to stay on top of your spending, Schweisthal said. Going up and down the aisles can sometimes make you crave things that you haven’t planned for, like a snack or a new dish. If you foresee that it’ll be hard for you to stick to your list, include some flexibility in your plan, such as allotting a specific amount to buy snacks or a random item you see at the checkout line. “I think having flexibility in a plan actually helps you stick to it more,” Schweisthal said. Making a plan can be as simple as writing down a list on paper or in your phone’s notes app. Or, you can use apps that specifically help you with meal planning such as AnyList or Mealime . If you tend to wander off your grocery list because every time you go to the store you buy things you don’t need, shopping online and picking up curbside is a good workaround. “I 100% recommend sitting down Sunday morning and just looking at the stores and comparing the items you need for the week, especially with things you can get for curbside pickup,” Torok said. If you buy your groceries from multiple stores because each has better prices on some items, ordering ahead of time can also save time. If you are in charge of buying groceries for your entire family, it can be beneficial to include them in your grocery budgeting routine. For Torok, this has meant teaching her children how to scan coupons while they shop. Since buying in bulk can be very cost-effective. Brindley also recommends that you team up with a friend or a family member to buy specific items in bulk and share the discount. Lastly, you can save money by using food-sharing apps such as Olio, which connects people around their community to share extra grocery items, and Too Good to Go, where you can buy surplus food at a discount.

        "headline": "Starting your first post-graduation job? Here’s how to organize your finances",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — With graduation season over, many college grads are embarking on summer internships or their first full-time jobs. Navigating your finances when you start adult life can be challenging, from understanding your health insurance and benefits to managing a budget. Finding a job is often the first hurdle, so if you’ve accomplished that, take a moment to be proud of yourself. “Once you do get that first job, pat yourself on the back,” said Nick Holeman, director of financial planning for Betterment, a financial advisory company. Then it’s time to think about your financial future. With credit card delinquencies growing and interest rates still high , it’s more important than ever for recent graduates to start their adult lives on the right financial track. Here are recommendations from experts about how to do that: Getting your first job is exciting, but the onboarding process can feel overwhelming. When you start a new job, most companies offer guidance about benefits such as your 401(k) and health insurance. It’s a lot of information, but it’s important not to ignore it, Holeman said. One key thing to focus on is your employer-sponsored retirement plan. While many companies automatically enroll you, Holeman recommends you save more than the typical 2% to 3%. Automatic enrollment allows your employer to take a set amount from your paycheck to allocate to a retirement investment account. You can choose to opt out or increase the amount you contribute. “Because you’re automatically enrolled doesn’t mean you can’t go in and increase how much you’re contributing,” he said. “And that’s a great way to build those automatic savings habits that around going to take you throughout the rest of your career.” Some recent grads might stay on their parents’ health insurance while others might enroll in an employers’ health insurance plan. But if your job doesn’t offer health insurance, experts recommend you enroll in the Affordable Care Act . “You shouldn’t go uninsured if you are going to be working for an employer that doesn’t offer health insurance,” said Louise Norris, health policy analyst for healthinsurance.org. While you’re navigating the ACA’s marketplace, you must take into consideration your budget, health, and availability of doctors in your area. If your employer offers several health insurance plans, Norris recommends learning the details of the plans, such as your deductible, co-pays and use policy. If you’re generally healthy and don’t go to the doctor often, Holeman recommends you choose a high-deductible health plan, because it will allow you to save money in a health savings account , also known as an HSA. An HSA lets you set aside pre-tax money to pay for medical expenses, which can help you cut out-of-pocket costs when you visit the doctor. Emergencies are tough to prepare for because you never know when they will happen and how expensive they will be. However, it’s a good practice to have an emergency fund that will alleviate some of the financial burden if something goes wrong. “Think of your emergency fund as a ‘break glass in case of emergency,’” said Holeman, who recommended that you keep your emergency savings in a separate bank account. Emergency fund amounts vary depending on each person’s circumstances but Holeman recommends that you save three to six months of expenses. This is an ideal scenario, but any amount of savings can be helpful in case of an emergency. Credit cards can help build your credit score and develop good borrowing habits, but if not used carefully, they can also get you in a lot of debt. If you’re taking out your first credit card, Holeman recommends that you choose something that you can keep for a long time, since an important factor in your credit score is the length of your credit history. Holeman recommends your first credit card is one that doesn’t have a yearly fee and is easy to maintain. If you’ve had a credit card before, remember that to maintain a good credit score and not fall into credit card debt, you must pay off your balance on time every month. It’s best if you use your credit card to pay for things you can already afford, recommended Steve Pilloff, associate professor of finance at Costello College of Business at George Mason University. “Use it as a way to make payments rather than a way to borrow money. Focus on the card and not the credit,” Pilloff said. Budgeting is a key component of your financial life, whether you’re trying to save for your emergency fund or pay down debt. Budgets change along with your finances, so when you land that first full-time position and maybe move to a new city, you need to change your budget to reflect your current financial reality, Pilloff said. If you’re using your budget to find ways to cut costs, Holeman recommends you focus on big expenses, such as rent or transportation costs, rather than small ones such as coffee or shopping. If you have debt, Holeman also recommends you first focus on paying off high-interest debt. If you don’t have debt, focusing on building an emergency fund and saving for short-term goals is also a great place to start setting goals for yourself. Budgeting is not a one-time process. In order to achieve your financial goals, you have to continuously assess and adjust, Pilloff said. With apps like YNAB and EveryDollar , you can access and easily modify your budget at any time. However, the best way to stick to a budget is finding the format that best works for you, whether that’s an Excel sheet or a notebook.

        "headline": "Credit card delinquencies are rising. Here’s what to do if you’re at risk",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Seriously overdue credit card debt is at the highest level in more than a decade, and people 35 and under are struggling more than other age groups to pay their bills. The share of credit card debt that’s severely delinquent, defined as being more than 90 days overdue, rose to 10.7% during the first quarter of 2024, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. A year ago, just 8.2% of credit card debt was severely delinquent. If you’re experiencing delinquency, or at risk of it, experts advise speaking with a nonprofit credit counselor and negotiating with your creditors directly. Here’s what you should know: Bruce McClary, senior vice president at the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, says that anyone at risk of delinquency should reach out as soon as possible for help from a nonprofit credit counselor, some of whom can be found through his organization . The consultation is free, and a non-judgmental counselor can give guidance towards a long-term solution. Nonprofits can also help create debt management plans that have lower interest rates, no late fees, and a single payment each month, McClary said. These plans may come with maintenance fees, which vary, but the fees are offset by the overall savings on the debt. McClary urged borrowers to be careful of scammers and for-profit debt consolidation companies, which often charge much higher fees than nonprofit organizations. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has a helpful breakdown comparing the two . Martin Lynch, president of the Financial Counseling Association of America, echoed this advice.  “Taking that first step and contacting a counselor is difficult for many people,” Lynch said. He emphasized that consumers in debt should do their best to “first, relax,” and then to be as forthcoming as possible about their circumstances with the counselor. “You’ll be talking to someone for free, who will listen to you describe your situation,” he said. “You can share your concerns without being judged for falling into difficulty.” Both Lynch and McClary urge borrowers to reach out directly to credit card companies to negotiate interest rates, fees, and long-term payment plans, noting that it’s in the companies’ best interests if you pay before the debt goes into collections. “The best thing to do is to reach out, give an honest assessment of your ability to pay over time, and ask what options are available to you both ‘on and off-the-menu,’” McClary said. This kind of phrasing can give creditors an opening to offer more flexibility, he said. McClary and other experts stress that most credit card companies and other lenders have hardship programs available for cases like these. Such options gained visibility during the COVID-19 pandemic, when more companies publicly advertised that consumers facing difficulty may skip or defer payments without penalties. The average annual interest rate on a new credit card is 24.71%, according to LendingTree, the highest since the company began tracking in 2019. That’s in part because the Federal Reserve has raised its key interest rate rate to a 23-year high to combat the highest inflation in four decades, which peaked at 9.1% in June 2022. Simultaneously, pandemic-era aid such as stimulus payments, the child tax credit, increased unemployment benefits, and a moratorium on student loan payments has ended. Wage gains haven’t all kept up with inflation, which hits lower-income consumers harder, and rent increases have eaten into savings some consumers may have built up during the early years of the pandemic. Silvio Tavares, CEO of VantageScore, a credit score modeling and analytics company, said that delinquencies have now exceeded their pre-pandemic levels, and that renters are especially vulnerable to falling behind . “Younger and less affluent people are experiencing challenges,” he said. “And high interest rates are having an effect.” Tavares said the most important thing a borrower can do is to know their credit score and keep up with payments to avoid paying additional interest on revolving balances and debt. He cautioned consumers not to over-extend themselves with “buy now, pay later” loans , which are increasingly available “at every checkout.” Credit cards only make up about 6.5% of consumer debt, according to a Bank of America Global Research report, but the increase in delinquencies appears to be outpacing income growth . According to McClary, there’s also likely a large group of consumers paying minimum balances and staying out of delinquency for now but who are too financially stressed to pay their balances in full. A worsening of the economy could push those consumers into severe delinquency, he said. On top of increasing credit card delinquencies, retail spending stalled in April. Walmart has said its customers are spending more on necessities and less on discretionary goods. Starbucks lowered its sales expectations, and McDonald’s is offering more deals as people cut back.

        "headline": "Tempted to try a no-buy year? Here are tips from people doing it",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — The rules of a no-buy challenge are self-imposed and simple: Make a list of the non-essential items you won’t spend money on for a set period of time and stick to it. Easier said than done. Many people start such challenges at the beginning of the year and commit to keep going until the end of it. But any time can be the right one for those looking to tackle their credit card debt, declutter their homes or to spend less time shopping. Some challenge participants begin with a no-spend month. “I commend anyone who realizes they’re just buying too much because North America is very consumer-focused and there’s too much waste,” said Carrie Rattle, the CEO of financial coaching company Behavioral Cents. Thinking of what you would be better off living without? These are some recommendations from experts and people already participating in the challenge. AP correspondent Shelley Adler reports on the ‘No Buy Year’ challenge. Whether it’s makeup, ordering takeout food or buying unnecessary trinkets in the $1 section at Target, knowing your vulnerabilities will help you make a realistic plan for staying on track. Before starting her no-buy year, Mia Westrap, a Ph.D. student in Southhampton, England, took a close look at what she spent money on during the previous few months. She decided that unnecessary food and beverages were her weakness. “I figured out that I was spending four figures on just carbonated drinks and Pepsi Max,” she said.  One of the fun parts of a no-buy challenge is that there are no set rules. Individuals choose what to include and exclude. San Diego resident Amea Wadsworth, 22, used to love spending hours looking at clothes and quirky knickknacks at Target and Goodwill. But when she moved back home after graduating college, she realized how many things she had accumulated through the years. “When I have those decluttering moments and I look through all my stuff, I was finding things that I bought and spent a lot of money on and then never ended up wearing,” Wadsworth said. For her challenge, she chose to not buy new clothing items and prioritized spending on experiences with her loved ones. Wadsworth also started her challenge by doing it month by month. Writing down the rules that fit your needs may help you stay on track. However, it’s also fine to tweak some of the rules as you move along in your experience. Finances are very connected to emotions, and emotions sometimes can make you feel like buying something you don’t need. When Wadsworth feels an impulse to get something she saw on social media or at a story, she writes it down instead of immediately purchasing the item. At the end of the month, she reviews the list and decides what, if anything, still is worth buying. “I look back and I see how many things I wrote and I’m like ’I’m glad that I didn’t buy that because I really didn’t need it,’” Wadsworth said. If you impulse buy, it might be helpful to write down the things you want to purchase and take some time to think further about the utility of the item. Between pop-up promotions and influencers swooning over new merchandise, social media can be a trigger for unnecessary shopping, according to Courtney Alev, a consumer financial advocate at Credit Karma. If you think screen time is compounding your overspending habit, Alev recommends taking a break from following accounts that bring on the urge to pull out a credit card. When Westrap began her no-buy year, she felt like the universe was conspiring against her. Her car broke down one month, and the next she received an expensive fine for an overdue parking ticket she was unaware of. Unexpected expenses or weak moments happen to everyone, and it’s OK if you don’t follow your no-buy year rules exactly as you had planned. The effort matters. “If you fail, you probably need a bit more help. You are not a failure. You have simply failed at one method,” Rattle said. “And that’s really important because I don’t want people to feel dejected.” Building a new habit and managing your finances can be difficult. Try to be gentle with yourself in the process. The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

        "headline": "People are embracing the ‘no-buy year’ to save money and the environment",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — A 35-year-old Brooklyn resident gave up buying new clothes. A 22-year old in San Diego swore off retail therapy at Target . A 26-year old in England banned carbonated drinks from her shopping list. These three women, who don’t know each other, all started the year resolving to spend money only on necessary purchases, or what is popularly known as engaging in a no-buy challenge. The self-imposed rules of the challenge are simple: participants pledge to stop buying non-essential items, be they unneeded shoes, additional beauty products or other impulse buys for a set amount of time, usually 12 months. What started several years ago as a blogged-about experiment in budgeting and mindful spending has become a popular trend on social media . A Reddit group where people share their experiences has 51,000 members. The challenge primarily gained popularity on TikTok, where some videos of users seeking to hold themselves accountable get hundreds of thousands of views. Elysia Berman, a creative director who lives in Brooklyn, decided she needed to drastically change her spending habits after she accumulated a collection of vintage designer clothing and a five-figure credit card debt. Her no-buy pledge included no new clothes , getting makeup and hair products only after she finished the ones she had, and limiting social outings to low- or no-expense activities. For Berman, adopting a more frugal lifestyle is serving one purpose: paying down her credit card debt . “It wasn’t like I wanted to challenge myself. I’m really in a position where this is a necessary next step for me,” she said. This article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well. Both sticking to her pledge and making progress toward her financial goal have proven more difficult than Berman expected. Within two weeks of starting her challenge, she couldn’t resist buying a new beret. Next came a new pair of boots. Although the challenge has helped her reduce her spending, she isn’t accruing savings as much as living within her means.  “Having this lifestyle adjustment, I was anticipating that it would make a huge difference in my ability to pay down my debt,” Berman said. Talking about any personal financial struggles is difficult for most people, but Berman approached hers head-on by discussing her financial struggles with friends and family and then posting about these issues on social media. The latter action resulted in more exposure than she originally expected; she has over 60,000 followers on TikTok , where a video in which she displayed her empty skin and hair products received over 1 million views. While the trend has been growing for some time, the beginning of 2024 provided another opportunity for people to gain back agency over their finances following the “doom spending” of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Courtney Alev, a consumer financial advocate for the personal finance company Credit Karma. “It’s just people trying to reclaim what’s been a rampant cycle of overspending, to be able to get their financial situation back in order and be able to save money,” Alev said. Not everyone electing to join the no-buy trend has debt. Amea Wadsworth, who moved back home to San Diego, California, after graduating college, wanted to use her first full-time job as a chance to save, both the environment and money for her future. After returning to live with her mom, she began noticing how many things she had that took up space. Working for a sustainability app also has made her more aware of her personal contribution to the world’s mountains of waste. “I’m tracking everything that I’m spending. I’m writing it all down,” said Wadsworth, who also writes down the times she wants to buy something but doesn’t. She reviews the entries at the end of the month to determine if her purchases were really necessary purchase or a response to a quick craving. Mia Westrap, a PhD student from Southampton, England, also uses TikTok as a way to keep herself accountable during her no-buy year. Her goal is to save three months’ worth of rent, since she currently lives month-to-month. While Berman’s Achilles’ heel was fashion items, Westrap’s was food and beverages. “I figured out that I was spending four figures on just carbonated drinks and Pepsi Max,” she said. Since social activities like going out for dinner or drinks involve spending money, Westrap decided to put a pause on dating during her yearlong no-buy challenge. “I don’t want to turn up to a date and expect them to pay for me,” she said. “And I also don’t want to get up to date and meet someone and be ‘Oh look, I make these TikToks about not spending any money and here I am,’” Other no-spend participants give themselves some latitude. Wadsworth, for example, is not buying any physical items but does allow herself to occasionally eat out with friends and the cost of visiting her long-distance boyfriend. Sabrina Pare, 31, of Detroit, Michigan, approached cutting back on purchases from an environmental perspective. A sustainable living aficionado with a large social media following, Pare decided to participate in the no-buy year as a way to limit her contribution to the world’s waste. She began by decluttering her closet and then looked for environmentally friendly ways to build a minimalist wardrobe, like hosting a clothing swap and avoiding fashion trends . At every step, Pare brings her followers along by filming short videos and sharing tips. “If you’re buying less, it’s better for the planet. Overconsumption, it’s such an issue in our society,” she said. But just as social media can be used for accountability and support when participating in the no-buy year challenge, it’s also one of the reasons many overspend. Berman, for example, stopped following a lot of fashion influencers to reduce the urge to buy things. Learning to avoid impulsive shopping takes rethinking your habits and becoming aware of your triggers, said Carrie Rattle, CEO of Behavioral Cents, a financial coaching company. “(The challenge) does help you try to push back against that need for dopamine. Every time we shop, any of us shop, we get that little dopamine hit,” Rattle said. While the challenge is meant to last for one year, people trying it say they are learning new techniques to help them avoid overspending in the future. Westrap carries a bag big enough to hold something to read when she leaves her apartment so she won’t have an excuse to buy more books. Pare unsubscribed from newsletters that tempted her to buy clothes and skincare products. Berman dyed her hair back to its natural brown since salon appointments to keep the color bright blonde were costly. “My consumer habits have changed so much through this,” Berman said. “Just because you see all the waste and you’re like, ‘Why is this necessary? Why buy a million little things when you can just buy one big thing, and it’s even better if it’s refillable.’” After she makes a significant dent in the credit card debt, Berman hopes to start saving and investing. Wadsworth plans to focus on spending her money on experiences with her loves ones rather than material things. Pare hopes to pay off her student loans. Wadsworth advises anyone who hears of the no-buy challenge and can’t imagine doing one to give it a try, even if it’s just for a month. “They say that it sounds so hard and yeah, it sounded hard to me, too. But if it sounds so terrifying to you, it probably means that you need it,” she said.

        "headline": "Buy now, pay later companies must adhere to credit card standards, consumer agency says",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Buy now, pay later companies must provide consumers with the same legal rights and protections as credit card lenders do, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said Wednesday in a new rule. That includes the right to demand a refund and to dispute transactions. The agency began an inquiry into the short-term lending industry two years ago, and it issued the rule in response to ongoing consumer complaints, it said. Here’s what you need to know. Buy now, pay later loans are typically marketed as zero-interest, or low interest, and allow consumers to spread out payments for purchases over several weeks or months. They’re marketed as a way to buy expensive products and services over time, and the service is typically offered at checkout for online shopping. It’s often used for big-ticket items, like furniture, clothes and airline tickets. In a report , the CFPB found that more than 13% of buy now, pay later transactions involved a return or dispute, and, in 2021, people disputed or returned $1.8 billion in transactions at the five companies surveyed. “Regardless of whether a shopper swipes a credit card or uses Buy Now, Pay Later, they are entitled to important consumer protections under longstanding laws and regulations already on the books,” CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement.  Two major buy now, pay later players — Affirm and Klarna — say they welcomed the regulation. “We are encouraged that the CFPB is promoting consistent industry standards, many of which already reflect how Affirm operates, to provide greater choice and transparency for consumers,” a company spokesperson said in a statement. Affirm currently offers “dispute and error resolution assistance,” the spokesman added. A spokesperson for Klarna said the company also already investigates consumer disputes and covers related refunds. The agency’s announcement is a “significant step forward” in regulating the buy now, pay later industry, Klarna said in a statement. It said it has been calling for regulatory oversight “over many years.” While some in the industry have voluntarily chosen to operate at the standard now mandated by the CFPB’s new rule, there remain significant differences between credit card lending and buy now, pay later loans. For instance, buy now, pay later lenders do not all report their loans to the three major credit bureaus. Some analysts have said this can lead consumers to overextend themselves or take on more debt than they can manage or afford. The CFPB said that buy now, pay later lenders need to extend many of the same rights and protections as classic credit card providers. “Importantly, these cover dispute and refund rights,” the agency said. The agency clarified that, with its new rule, buy now, pay later lenders must: — Investigate disputes. Lenders must also pause payment requirements during the investigation and sometimes must issue credits. — Refund returned products or canceled services. Buy now, pay later lenders must credit the refunds to consumers’ accounts. — Provide billing statements. Consumers must receive periodic statements of money owed similar to the ones received for classic credit card accounts. “The failure to provide dispute protections can create chaos for consumers when they return their merchandise or encounter other billing difficulties,” the CFPB said.

        "headline": "Your tax refund could be bigger this year. Here’s what to do with it",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — The average taxpayer is getting a $2,852 refund, $75 more than last year, based on the most recent IRS data. So what should you do with that money ? Experts generally advise putting it toward debt and savings , but, for many people, that’s unrealistic. A tax refund is typically the “biggest extra windfall of the year,” said Courtney Alev, consumer financial advocate at Credit Karma. “One thing we do see is a propensity to consider a tax refund something to splurge with. One in four taxpayers see it as free money and plan to spend it on something they would not otherwise,” she said. “While this behavior is completely understandable, given how hard up people are — with the rising cost of living, and high interest rates , the best thing you can do is use it as an opportunity to advance your financial goals.” Emily Garcia, 30, who works in marketing for a medical imaging software company in Toledo, Ohio, said she and her husband, with whom she filed jointly, were refunded about $1,000 and spent the money on patio furniture. “We wanted to dress up the backyard, to make it seem nice, and furniture’s not cheap,” she said. “It was a nice thing to have the refund check to be able to buy what we were looking at.” Though Garcia and her husband bought a house two years ago, which they’re still in the process of paying off, they decided not to put the refund toward their mortgage.  ”The debt’s not going anywhere,” said Garcia. “A thousand dollars is not going to make a dent. But it’s a good amount to buy something like furniture.” Megan McClelland, 38, who works as a head high school counselor in Petaluma, California, is spending her refund — just over $1,000 — on travel, such as trips for a bachelorette and a wedding. In October, McClelland had the last of her outstanding student loans cancelled through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program , and so is debt free for the first time in years. She said that the $500 she had budgeted for her monthly student loan payments is now going into her savings account, so she sees the refund as a chance to spend on “things that I probably otherwise wouldn’t be able to pay for — or that would bring me into debt.” In the past, McClelland said, she would typically have had to work extra shifts, moonlighting at a winery or as a caterer, to take a trip — or put the travel on the credit card. Now she can use the tax refund instead. “The way the tax refund works in my mind is I can use it more for ‘fun money,’” she said. As of late last month, the IRS had processed about 141 million returns and refunded roughly $261 billion to taxpayers, 2.2% more than at that time in 2023. Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree, echoed the idea that paying down debt and contributing to savings are the two most financially sound things to do with a tax refund, though he said people should do both simultaneously, rather than choosing between the two. “If you pay down debt to zero and you don’t have any savings, all that happens is the next time you have an emergency expense — like a flat tire or taking your dog to the vet — that expense just goes back on your credit card and you’re right back in debt,” he said. “If you can build a little bit of savings while you’re paying off loans you can break that cycle of debt so many people find themselves in.” Said Alev: “Life is short, we want to reward ourselves. And we see a diverse set of responses (with tax refunds). Our best tip is to use that refund to get your financial life on track. At the treetop, that’s what we’re seeing and advising.” The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

        "headline": "The Fed indicated rates will remain higher for longer. What does that mean for you?",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Mortgage rates , credit card rates , auto loan rates , and business loans with variable rates will all likely maintain their highs, with consequences for consumer spending, after the Federal Reserve indicated Wednesday that it doesn’t plan to cut interest rates until it has “greater confidence” that price increases at the consumer level are slowing to its 2% target. The central bank kept its key rate at a two-decade high of roughly 5.3%, where it has been since last August. Here’s what to know: Credit card rates are at or near all-time peaks, and mortgage rates have more than doubled in recent years. According to LendingTree, the average credit card interest rate in America today is 24.66%, unchanged from last month, though that rate has risen for 24 of the last 26 months. “That isn’t likely to fall anytime soon, despite the Fed taking its foot off the gas,” said LendingTree Credit Analyst Matt Schulz. “That’s likely the unfortunate reality for the next several months.” In the battle against credit card debt, 0% balance transfer cards “are still your best weapon,” according to Schulz, but “they’re getting harder to get and their fees are rising.” With delinquencies and debt totals also increasing for consumers, some banks are becoming more hesitant about taking on transferred balances, he said, meaning consumers will need good credit to get approval. Yields on savings accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs) have been hovering at high levels, thanks to the Fed’s increased interest rates, according to Ken Tumin, banking expert and founder of DepositAccounts.com. That said, “several banks have been lowering deposit rates (with the) expectation that the Fed will start cutting rates at some point this year.” Certificate of deposit rates have been the first to fall, and a few online banks have also started lowering online savings account rates. Ally Bank dropped its rate to 4.25% from 4.35% and Discover to 4.25% from 4.30%. Even so, most online banks held their online savings account rates steady in 2024, and several online banks still offer yields of 5.25%. The highest online yield is currently 5.55%, with the average online 1-year CD yield 4.94% as of April 1st, according to DepositAccounts.com. Tumin notes that “brick-and-mortar bank deposit rates continue to be slow in their movement higher,” saying that while their average rates have gone up sharply in the last year, “they are still very low compared to online rates.” The average savings account yield for all banks and credit unions, of which the vast majority are brick-and-mortar, is 0.52% as of April 24th. The Fed doesn’t directly set mortgage rates, but it does influence them. The bond market, inflation, and other factors all contribute to the high mortgage rates currently facing consumers. The average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage recently rose to above 7% for the first time since November. LendingTree Senior Economist Jacob Channel notes that mortgage rates can shift even as the Fed holds its benchmark rate steady, and that consumers should consider many economic data points before deciding to take on a mortgage. “Even in the face of relatively steep mortgage rates and high prices, now could still be a good time to buy a home,” he said. “Timing the market is virtually impossible... In that same vein, there are a lot of people who won’t be able to buy until the market becomes cheaper.” High shelter and rent costs have contributed to steep inflation in recent months. A Bankrate study found that renting is cheaper than buying a typical home in all 50 of the largest U.S. metro areas. As of February, the typical monthly mortgage payment on a median-priced home in the U.S. was $2,703, while the typical national monthly rent was $1,979. That’s a nearly 37% gap between the costs of renting and buying a home. “While it would be nice if the Fed could fix everything on its own, it probably can’t, at least not without causing a great deal of weeping and gnashing of teeth,” said Channel. While vehicle prices have steadied through late 2023 and early 2024, Bankrate Chief Financial Analyst Greg McBride predicts that high interest rates on auto loans will linger for those with weak credit profiles. Borrowers with stronger credit may see more competitive rates, but the Fed’s decision will continue to make auto loans expensive, even if vehicle prices decline. The average car loan hasn’t been this pricey since 2008. McBride predicts five-year new car loan rates will reach an average of 7.0% and four-year used car loans, 7.5% by the end of 2024. In the past year, borrowers have f aced especially expensive monthly payments due to high interest rates, and auto loan delinquency reached its highest rate in nearly thirty years. The average monthly car loan payment was $738 for new vehicles and $532 for used ones in the fourth quarter of 2023, according to credit reporting agency Experian. New vehicles cost an average of $47,218 in March 2024, according to Kelley Blue Book , a price that, combined with high interest rates, pushes many buyers out of the market for new cars. Not as quickly as it would like. Several recent reports on prices and economic growth have undercut the Fed’s belief that inflation was steadily easing. “Inflation has shown a lack of further progress toward our 2% objective,” said Chair Jerome Powell. While inflation has cooled from a peak of 7.1% to 2.7%, average prices remain well above pre-pandemic levels, and the costs of services continue to grow — including for rents, health care, restaurant meals, and auto insurance.

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Borrowers with some types of federal student loans have until today to consolidate their loans to qualify for full student loan cancellation or credit toward cancellation. The Education Department is expected to conduct a one-time adjustment in the summer but borrowers who want to be considered for the adjustment have to submit a request to consolidate their loans by Tuesday. This one-time adjustment is meant to show a more accurate payment count for student loan borrowers. Here’s what you need to know: Borrowers with these types of loans must consolidate first to take advantage of this one-time adjustment: — Commercially managed Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) loans — Parent PLUS loans — Perkins loans — Health Education Assistance Loan (HEAL) Program loans You can learn more about the one-time adjustment at studentaid.gov . The deadline to consolidate your loans is Tuesday. If you have multiple federal student loans, you can combine them into one loan with fixed interest. If you decide to consolidate your loans into a Direct Consolidation Loan, you can do so for free. Once you have consolidated your loans, you will have one monthly payment instead of multiple payments a month. You can apply to consolidate your loans at studentaid.gov/loan-consolidation . The consolidation process typically takes around 60 days to complete. Once you consolidate your loans, you will be eligible for the adjustment.

        "headline": "These apps allow workers to get paid between paychecks. Experts say there are steep costs",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — When Anna Branch, 37, had her hours at work reduced in 2019, she suddenly noticed ads for an app called EarnIn. “You know how they get you — the algorithms — like they’re reading your mind,” Branch said. “The ad said I could get up to $100 this week and repay it in my next pay period.” Branch, who was working as an administrative assistant in Charleston, South Carolina, downloaded the app and added the suggested “tip.” The cash helped her cover expenses until payday, when the app debited the borrowed $100, plus $14 for tip. Five years later, Branch said she still uses the app, as often as once a month. EarnIn is one of more than a dozen companies that provide this service, billed as Earned Wage Access. The apps extend small short-term loans to workers in between paychecks so they can pay bills and meet everyday needs. On payday, the user repays the money out of their wages. Between 2018 and 2020, transaction volume tripled from $3.2 billion to $9.5 billion, according to Datos Insights. While Earned Wage Access apps have been around for over a decade, the pandemic and its aftermath boosted their popularity. Some apps have approachable human names — like Dave, Clio, Albert, and Brigit — while others suggest financial freedom: Empower, FloatMe, FlexWage, Rain. The typical user earns less than $50,000 a year, according to the Government Accountability Office, and has experienced the pinch of two years of high inflation . Proponents of the apps say they help people living paycheck to paycheck manage their finances and avoid the need for more onerous options, such as payday loans or overdrawing a bank account. But some analysts, consumer advocates and lawmakers say the apps are actually payday loans in a new tech wrapper, and that they can trap users in an endless cycle of borrowing that depletes their earnings.  Critics also say the costs of the loans are not always transparent. Many charge monthly subscription fees and most charge mandatory fees for instant transfers of funds, though there is typically a no-cost option to receive funds in one to three business days. The average APR for a loan repaid in seven to 14 days was 367%, a rate comparable to payday lending, according to a report from the Center for Responsible Lending . Muddying the waters is the fact that some employers have integrated Earned Wage Access apps into their payroll, with different costs, models, and fee structures. Amazon and Walmart, for example, do not always charge employees for early access to earned wages outside of regular pay periods. Sheri Wilkins, 60, who works as a home health aide in College Station, Texas, said she’s used the apps since 2020, and that she feels “dependent on the money.” The health care contractor that employs Wilkins offers DailyPay, and Wilkins typically uses the app to transfer the amount of that day’s wages ($10.60 an hour) twice a day — once after each of her two shifts, for which she’s paid separately. Each time, she pays a $3.49 fee, for a total of $7 a day. At $35 a week, the app eats up more than three hours of her pay weekly, or a-day-and-a-half’s work per month. “They get you hooked on having that money,” Wilkins said. “It’s fine and great to have it — to buy groceries and cigarettes — but when it comes time to have your paycheck, it’s only $50-$60.” Wilkins said she was not aware the app had a free option, which would transfer the money in one to three days. She said the app always directed her to the instant transfer option. A spokesperson for DailyPay said in a statement that the app offers two options with no fees to most users and a third with what they described as a “small ATM-like fee.” Matt Bahl, who researches workplace issues for the Financial Health Network, said the growth of the Earned Wage Access industry is a symptom of widespread financial insecurity. “It’s meant to help solve short-term liquidity challenges,” he said. “But if those challenges are the result of insufficient income, it won’t solve them. You can’t ‘tech’ your way out of material deficits.” Andrew Lewis, 32, who lives in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, said he uses EarnIn, in part to meet unexpected expenses. Lewis works as a process technician for an electronics manufacturing company, and said he sometimes uses the app as often as every week, for gas money or something his toddler or wife needs. Lewis usually pays the “tips” the apps suggest, he said, but he doesn’t “like them that much,” in part because of the messaging. “Tips keep us running for millions of members like you,” EarnIn’s in-app copy reads. The company says it uses tips to maintain a no-fee option. “I feel a little guilty because of how they make it sound,” Lewis said. In 2021, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation found “users often feel compelled to leave (tips) due to applied pressure tactics like... claiming tips are used to support other vulnerable consumers or for charitable purposes.” In its report, the department found that borrowers who use Earned Wage Access take out an average of 36 loans a year. On 5.8 million transactions, 73% of consumers paid a “tip,” at $4.09 per tip on average. On three dozen loans, that’s $147 annually in tips alone. Penny Lee, head of the Financial Technology Association, an industry group, says more people are turning to Earned Wage Access as a convenience that allows them to make up for the “disconnect between what the consumer needs to be able to spend … and their pay cycle.” Like Buy Now, Pay Later loans , the apps don’t run credit checks and bill themselves as interest-free. Unlike payday loans or auto title loans, where borrowers pledge their vehicles as collateral, users of the apps don’t face balloon payments, black marks on their credit reports, or the possibility of losing their car if they fail to pay. Supporters also say the apps don’t sue or send collectors after unpaid debts. The FTA says the average cost per use of an Earned Wage Access app is between $2.59 and $6.27. The companies say the charges are comparable to ATM fees and cheaper than overdraft fees , which people incur if they don’t have enough money left in a checking account to cover a bill before payday. The average overdraft fee is more than $25 and can be as high as $36. However, in its report, the Center for Responsible Lending found that users of the apps experienced a 56% increase in checking account overdrafts. A number of states have moved to regulate Earned Wage Access by capping fees on these products. The industry backs a federal bill, currently before Congress, that would exclude the apps from being regulated by the Truth in Lending Act. When Connecticut passed a law capping the fees the apps could charge, EarnIn stopped operating in the state. Asked why, EarnIn CEO Ram Palaniappan said it was no longer “economically viable.” Both California and Hawaii are currently drafting laws to rein in Earned Wage Access fees. Rep. Bryan Steil, R-WI, one of the federal bill’s backers said, it will “ensure workers across the country can continue to use these services, which help them to better connect work to reward.” But Hawaii State Sen. Chris Lee, a Democrat who introduced regulation targeting Earned Wage Access in the state Senate, called the 300-plus percentage interest rates a “modern payday loan scheme.” Lee said he would like to see more transparency and worker protections. Lauren Saunders, an attorney at the National Consumer Law Center, says this a pivotal moment for regulation. “If (Earned Wage Access) were being used by people to cover one emergency cost a year, it could be better than being subject to overdraft fees or payday or auto title loans,” she said. “But being better than terrible predatory products shouldn’t be the bar.” The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

        "headline": "Here’s how to reduce stress and get your taxes done",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — For many people, tax season isn’t only about gathering W-2 forms or calling an accountant. It can also bring intense feelings of stress or anxiety about dealing with finances. Financial stress during tax season can manifest in different ways, whether that’s procrastinating on your tax return until the last minute or experiencing intense stress about filing incorrectly. If you’re dealing with financial stress right now, you’re not alone. “Many Americans experience high stress during tax times, and many Americans are dealing with financial stress,” financial wellness expert Joyce Marter said. You might think emotions and money don’t go together, but they often affect each other, said Lindsay Bryan-Podvin, financial therapist and founder of Mind Money Balance. “Our money and mental health intersect because they’re two parts of our overall wellness,” said Bryan-Podvin. Here are recommendations from experts to reduce financial stress during tax season while still getting your return done by the deadline:  Financial stress can happen all year long. While tax season is only a window of time, it comes with something that can be daunting: a deadline. Some might find a deadline motivates them to get things done, while others can feel paralyzed by it, said Dr. Tanya Farber, psychologist at McLean Hospital, a mental health facility in Massachusetts. “If we’re overwhelmed by our anxiety, that’s where it may lead us to avoid thinking about finances or trying to avoid thinking about taxes,” Farber said. Although you do have an option of filing for an extension, Farber doesn’t recommend prolonging the period when you have to worry about taxes. Instead, a good first step is to make a detailed plan to tackle them. Farber recommends you break down all of the steps and start completing them one by one. A key step is to start gathering all of your documents, such as your W-2 or 1099 forms, savings and investment records, eligible deductions and tax credits , ahead of sitting down to file your taxes. Once you have a list of steps, scheduling times to complete the tasks will make it easier to build momentum. While the required documents might depend on your individual case, here is a general list of what everyone needs: If you need help making a plan, search for tax checklists, which can be a great tool to make sure you have everything you need.  For many, anxiety over filing taxes comes from fear, Farber said. Whether it’s fear of making a mistake in your return or unexpectedly owing thousands of dollars, these fears can overwhelm you to the point of avoiding even looking at your taxes. If you identify that fear is what’s stopping you from filing, Farber recommends that you ask yourself if whatever you’re afraid of is likely to happen. “When we have fears, they’re possible, probable or definite,” Farber said. “And oftentimes anxiety is the highest when we’re assuming the worst-case scenario.” If thinking about your fears by yourself is not helping, Bryan-Podvin recommends you discuss them with a friend or a family member. In many cases, talking with someone else might help you focus on what might actually happen rather than focusing on the worst-case scenarios. If tax season brings a lot of financial stress for you, Bryan-Podvin recommends that you increase the amount of self-care activities you’re doing. Activities such as taking a walk, spending time with your dog or getting enough sleep can help soothe stress. “We are going to be doing things that are difficult and depleting and anxiety-provoking so doing more things that are restorative can help us balance that,” Farber said. Doing restorative activities can work as a toolbox of coping skills when you’re in the middle of a stressful situation, like filing taxes. You might feel like you’ll be judged if you talk about money, but that’s often not the case. Talking about finances with your friends or family can be a moment to receive support, she said. “Talking with others is going to give you access to more information and resources and also helps remove the shame and stigma because you’re not alone,” Marter said. Whether it’s talking with a tax professional or reaching out to your most tax-savvy family member, proactively seeking support will help you avoid being stressed if you’re filing very close to the deadline. Additionally, if you are experiencing mental health struggles, there are several resources you can use to find professional help. In the U.S., you can dial 211 to speak with a mental health expert, confidentially and for free. Other mental health resources include: Veterans Crisis Line: call 1-800-273-TALK (8255) Crisis Text Line: Text the word ‘Home’ to 741-741 The Trevor Lifeline for LGBTQ Youth: 1-866-488-7386 The Trans Lifeline: 1-877-565-8860 The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

        "headline": "Internet providers must now be more transparent about fees, pricing, FCC says",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Much like nutritional labels on food products, “broadband labels” for internet packages will soon tell you just what is going into the pricing of your service, thanks to new rules adopted by the Federal Communications Commission this week. “If you’ve ever shopped for home or mobile internet, you can understand how hard it can be to understand what you’re actually paying for,” said Jon Donenberg, Deputy Director of the White House National Economic Council, on a call with reporters. “The broadband nutrition label is a tool that can help consumers make sure they have a clear, straightforward explanation of home and mobile services before signing up for anything.” Following the design of FDA food labels, these broadband labels will provide easy-to-understand, accurate information about the cost and performance of high-speed internet service to help consumers avoid junk fees, price hikes, and other unexpected costs. Internet service providers selling home access or mobile broadband plans will be required to have a label for each plan beginning April 10. The labels will be mandated to appear at any point of sale, including online and in stores, and they will be required to disclose all pricing information — including introductory rates, data allowances, and speeds. The labels will also include links to information about network management practices and privacy policies. Here’s what you need to know.  Hidden fees and unexpected rate hikes have dogged consumers shopping for internet service for years, and the Biden administration has been cracking down on “junk fees” (opaque and misleading fee structures) across industries — including banking, hotel and airline pricing, and utility and phone services — for the past several years. On a call Tuesday, a spokesperson for the FCC clarified that the labels “cannot be buried in multiple clicks” or hidden in a way that a consumer might miss. “Fees can make it hard to understand the true cost of an internet plan,” said Donenberg, adding that the agency is “committed to rooting out surprise junk fees that some companies pile on to your bills.” 1.

        "headline": "Here’s how to protect yourself from common scams this tax season",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Tax season can come with several headaches, from gathering documents to finding the time to sit down and file . But one pain that you want to avoid is falling for a tax scam. Year-round, scammers look for ways to trick people into giving them money or personal information. There are several common types of scams during tax season, so people should be on the lookout for red flags, said Amy Nofziger, director of victim support at the AARP Fraud Watch Network. One of the most common types of scams is related to identity theft. Taxpayers usually know their identity has been stolen when they try to file their tax returns and the IRS says they’ve already done so. This usually means someone else filed in their name in order to receive a refund. In 2023, the IRS received 294,138 identity theft complaints. The IRS says taxpayers who are victims of tax-related identity theft wait an average of 19 months for the IRS to process their returns and send their refunds. Here are some expert recommendations to protect yourself from scams during tax season:  Three common tactics used by scammers are based on fear, urgency and money, said security expert Petros Efstathopoulos. Here’s how they work: — Fear When a scammer contacts you via phone or email, they use language that makes it seem like there is a problem that you need to solve. For example, a scammer contacts you over email telling you that your tax return has an error and if you don’t fix it you’ll get in trouble. — Urgency Because scammers are good at creating a sense of urgency, people tend to rush, which makes them vulnerable. Scammers often tell people they need to act right away, which can lead to them sharing private information such as their Social Security numbers. “When people are under pressure and under anxiety, they might do something with the speed that they’re not thinking through it and not doing their research,” Nofziger said. — Money Scammers use money as bait, Efstathopoulos said. They might impersonate tax professionals or the IRS saying you will get a bigger refund than you expect if you pay them for their services or share your personal information. It’s very important to know that the IRS never reaches out via unconventional means, said Dr. Zulfikar Ramzan, chief scientist at Aura, a digital security company. The IRS usually contacts taxpayers via physical mail through the U.S. Postal Service. “Typically, they’re going to ask you to contact them either via their website or by sending correspondence directly to their main address, which is easy to verify,” Ramzan said. A common impersonation scam is when someone calls you claiming they work for the IRS and demanding an immediate payment, Nofziger said. You can find out more about how the IRS contacts people here .  If you need help from a tax professional, research them to make sure they are not imposters, Nofziger said. “You’ll see advertisements for low-cost tax preparers that can get you more money than anybody else,” Nofziger said. “They will advertise on social media or set up shops in strip malls.” To avoid getting scammed by fake tax preparers, Nofziger recommends that you look for reputable lists. Options include the IRS directory of tax professionals and the AARP Foundation tax-aid locator . Scammers often reach out by phone and Efstathopoulos recommends that you don’t share information on incoming calls. “If my bank calls me and says ‘Hi, I need some information’, I say ‘Thank you very much, I’ll call you back on the number I know is yours,’” Efstathopoulos said. That makes it easier to know for sure that you’re not talking to a scammer. As a general rule of thumb, banks don’t often call unless there is suspicious activity on your account or if you previously contacted them about a problem with your account. If you receive many unknown calls that end up being scammers or robocalls, Nofziger recommends using tools available on your phone to block spam. Check here for how to do this on you iPhone and here for Android . Filing your taxes early is always recommended in case someone else tries to file for you, Efstathopoulos said. But if that is not an option, you can take other steps that make you less vulnerable to scams. These include using the IRS pin system, having a password manager and checking that your computer doesn’t have a virus. — Identity protection PIN The IRS offers an identity protection PIN , which is a six-digit number, to protect taxpayers from someone else filing for them. This number helps the IRS verify your identity when you’re filing. “Every time you see an opportunity to turn on two-factor authentication, take it and make sure it’s turned on,” Efstathopoulos recommended. — Password manager Efstathopoulos also recommends using a password manager on your devices to ensure you’re utilizing a complex password that scammers can’t guess. — Credit report check Regularly checking your credit report and bank statements is a good practice since it can help you identify if someone has been using your bank account without your knowledge, Ramzan said. If your bank lets you set alerts for big transactions you should take advantage of that extra security measure, he added. — Clean your computer If you’re filing your tax returns online, you want to make sure your computer is free of viruses, Ramzan said. Even if the tax filing software you’re using is safe, if your computer has a virus, someone could steal your personal information. If you’ve taken all the necessary steps to protect yourself, you might want to help those around you, Nofziger said. Whether you’re helping your grandparents to block unknown callers on their phones or sharing tips with your neighbors, talking with others about how to protect themselves from scams can be very effective. Even when you’ve already filed your taxes, there are other scams that you should keep an eye out for. Scams surrounding refunds and tax corrections are some of the most common. “We know that wherever the money is, the criminals are going to be there,” Nofziger said. “And that includes this time when there is money being sent to people.” Find more of AP’s tax season coverage here: https://apnews.com/hub/personal-finance The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

        "headline": "How freelancers can prepare for changing tax requirements",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Workers across different industries are increasingly receiving some or all of their income via apps. They include tutors, graphic designers, hair stylists, and all kinds of independent and self-employed workers, along with merchants who sell products online through Etsy, eBay, Amazon and other sites. But tax law is still catching up when it comes to how best to report this income. If you’re a freelancer or gig worker who receives payments via apps like Venmo, Zelle, Cash App or PayPal , your tax reporting requirements will change for the 2024 tax year. The law will not affect the amount of taxes owed , but it will change how you report income with 1099-K forms. The changes were supposed to take effect for the 2023 tax year, but they have been delayed. The tax filing deadline is April 15.  For the current tax year, freelancers and small business owners still only need to use 1099-K forms to report third-party app payments totaling $20,000, and any number of payments above 200. But beginning next year, that threshold will be just $5,000, which will eventually be lowered to $600. The changes were supposed to take effect for the 2023 tax year, but they have been delayed. Some in the space say the new law will benefit both freelancers and the IRS by improving information gathering, especially for people who are self-employed and merchants who sell online. Freelancers, gig workers, and online sellers owe taxes on their income regardless of whether they meet the reporting threshold to use 1099-K forms, but it can be difficult to keep track of every payment, especially across sites and apps. This can lead to confusion and underpayment, experts say. The eventual change will affect platforms, businesses, and individuals, and it’s good to begin preparing now. Here’s what you need to know: If you’re already keeping accurate track of your income from freelancing as paid via Venmo, Zelle, Cash App, PayPal, and other sites, you’re in good shape. The main difference will be that these platforms will issue you additional forms for every transaction. This should make correct reporting to the IRS even easier, though there will be more paperwork. Currently, if someone paying a freelancer via Venmo, Zelle, or CashApp sends a form to the IRS reporting that pay, but the freelancer doesn’t report the income with the same form, that creates a “matching error” for the agency. The change will ensure both that taxpayers receive proper refunds and that the IRS receives proper payment. In some cases, in part due to the changing guidance, platforms may send taxpayers 1099-K Forms in error this year — such as for transactions between family and friends or for expense sharing between roommates, according to the IRS. The first thing to do is try to get an updated form by contacting the company that issued the form incorrectly. If you can’t get one in a timely manner, the IRS says to zero out the income on your tax return with the description “Form 1099-K Received in Error.” The line appears on Form 1040 - Additional Income and Adjustments to Income. There, you should write, as follows: “Part I – Line 8z – Other Income – Form 1099-K Received in Error.” The change, which had been set to take effect this year, was delayed again in November. The IRS decided to give taxpayers another year to adjust to the new reporting requirements. “Taking this phased-in approach is the right thing to do for the purposes of tax administration, and it prevents unnecessary confusion,” IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in November. “It’s clear that an additional delay for tax year 2023 will avoid problems for taxpayers, tax professionals and others in this area.” The IRS has an online Gig Economy Tax Center that focuses specifically on the tax questions and needs of freelancers and other workers in the informal economy. The site addresses common concerns and pitfalls. The IRS will be in touch if they see discrepancies between income reported on 1099-K forms by taxpayers and companies issuing the forms, both this year and next. It’s important to keep in mind that income from all platforms, including things like YouTube ads and Patreon subscriptions, must be reported in this way. One way to make sure all income is accurately captured is to be sure to transfer all payments from your PayPal, Venmo, and Cash App accounts to a traditional bank account, rather than keeping it on third-party platforms.

        "headline": "What to know about the SAVE plan, the income-driven plan to repay student loans",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — More than 7.5 million student loan borrowers have enrolled in the U.S. government’s newest repayment plan since it launched in August. President Joe Biden recently announced that he was canceling federal student loans for nearly 153,000 borrowers enrolled in the plan, known as the SAVE plan . Forgiveness was granted to borrowers who had made payments for at least 10 years and originally borrowed $12,000 or less. The SAVE plan was created last year to replace other existing income-based repayment plans offered by the federal government. More borrowers are now eligible to have their monthly payments reduced to $0, and many will qualify for lower payments compared to other repayment plans. For Lauran Michael and her husband, the SAVE plan has reduced student loan payments by half. Since getting married, they’ve both been paying off her husband’s student loans, which would have amounted to about $1,000 a month when payments resumed after a pause during the pandemic. Under the SAVE plan, their payments are now $530 a month. “We don’t want our loans dictating our life choices, and us not being able to do other things because we’re paying so much money. The SAVE plan is definitely a game changer for us,” said Michael, a 34-year-old interior designer in Raleigh, North Carolina. Michael’s family is paying for daycare for their two children using the money they saved from not making payments during the pandemic and the reduced payments under the SAVE plan. If you are interested in applying for the SAVE plan, here’s what you need to know:  The U.S. Education Department offers several plans for repaying federal student loans. Under the standard plan, borrowers are charged a fixed monthly amount that ensures all their debt will be repaid after 10 years. But if borrowers have difficulty paying that amount, they can enroll in one of several plans that offer lower monthly payments based on income and family size. Those are known as income-driven repayment plans. Income-driven options have been offered for years and generally cap monthly payments at 10% of a borrower’s discretionary income. If a borrower’s earnings are low enough, their bill is reduced to $0. And after 20 or 25 years, any remaining debt gets erased. More borrowers in the SAVE plan are eligible for $0 payments. This plan won’t require borrowers to make payments if they earn less than 225% of the federal poverty line — $32,800 a year for a single person. The cutoff for other plans, by contrast, is 150% of the poverty line, or $22,000 a year for a single person. Also, the SAVE plan prevents interest from piling up. As long as borrowers make their monthly payments, their overall balance won’t increase. Once they cover their adjusted monthly payment — even if it’s $0 — any remaining interest is waived. Other major changes will take effect in July 2024. Payments on undergraduate loans will be capped at 5% of discretionary income, down from 10% now. Those with graduate and undergraduate loans will pay between 5% and 10%, depending on their original loan balance. The maximum repayment period is capped at 20 years for those with only undergraduate loans and 25 years for those with any graduate school loans. The SAVE plan is available to all student loan borrowers in the Direct Loan Program who are in good standing on their loans. Read more about the SAVE plan here . Borrowers can apply to the SAVE plan using the Income-Driven Repayment Plan request through the Education Department’s website. If you are one of the borrowers who is benefitting from forgiveness under the SAVE plan, you will receive an email from the Education Department. If you’ve worked for a government agency or a nonprofit , the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program offers cancellation after 10 years of regular payments, and some income-driven repayment plans cancel the remainder of a borrower’s debt after 20 to 25 years. Borrowers should make sure they’re signed up for the best possible income-driven repayment plan to qualify for these programs. Borrowers who have been defrauded by for-profit colleges may also apply for relief through a program known as Borrower Defense. If you’d like to repay your federal student loans under an income-driven plan, the first step is to fill out an application through the Federal Student Aid website . Several categories of borrowers would be eligible for relief under Biden’s second try at widespread cancellation after the Supreme Court rejected his first plan last year. The proposed plan includes relief for borrowers who have been paying their loans for at least 20 or 25 years, automatic forgiveness for borrowers who are eligible for income-driven repayment plans but are not enrolled, and loan cancellation for borrowers who attended a for-profit college that left them unable to pay their student loans, among others. Whether any of the relief will materialize is a looming question as conservatives vow to challenge any attempt at mass student loan cancellation. The new proposal is narrower, focusing on several categories of borrowers who could get some or all of their loans canceled, but legal challenge is almost certain. Currently, borrowers who are eligible for forgiveness under the SAVE program will get their loans discharged on a rolling basis, according to the Education Department. This story was first published on March 10, 2024. It was updated on March 18, 2024, to correct the number of borrowers who have enrolled in the government’s newest repayment plan.

        "headline": "Tax day is underway. Here are some tips to navigate it",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — April 15 is the last day to submit tax returns for 2023. If you left your tax filing to the last minute, you’re not alone. The IRS says it has received more than 100 million tax returns , with tens of millions more expected. If you need more time, today is also the deadline to file an extension, which will give you until Oct. 15 to file your taxes. Whether it’s your first time filing or you’ve been doing it for years, here are some key things to know about tax season: Taxpayers have until April 15 to submit their returns from 2023. If you run out of time to file your tax return, you can file for an extension . However, it is important to remember that the extension is only to file your taxes, not to pay them. If you owe taxes, you should pay an estimated amount before the deadline so you avoid paying penalties and interest. If you expect to receive a refund, you will still receive your money when you file your taxes. You can file for an extension to Oct. 15 through your tax software or preparer of preference, the IRS Free File tool or via mail.  While the required documents might depend on your individual case, here is a general list of what everyone needs: —Social Security number —W-2 forms, if you are employed —1099-G, if you are unemployed —1099 forms, if you are self-employed —Savings and investment records —Any eligible deduction, such as educational expenses, medical bills, charitable donations, etc. —Tax credits, such as child tax credit, retirement savings contributions credit, etc. To find a more detailed document list, visit the IRS website. Tom O’Saben, director of tax content and government relations at the National Association of Tax Professionals, recommends gathering all of your documents in one place before you start your tax return and also having your documents from last year if your financial situation has drastically changed. O’Saben also recommends taxpayers create an identity protection PIN number with the IRS to guard against identity theft. Once you create a number, the IRS will require it to file your tax return. You can either file your taxes online or on paper . However, there is a big time difference between the two options. Paper filing can take up to six months for the IRS to process, while electronic filing cuts it down to three weeks.  The IRS is piloting a program where you can file your federal taxes online for free called Direct File . This program is now available in 12 states, which include California and New York, and for people who have very simple W-2s , an employee’s wage and tax statement. Aside from Direct File, IRS offers free guided tax preparation that does the math for you. This is available for people who make $79,000 or less per year. If you have questions while working on your tax forms, the IRS also offers an interactive tax assistant tool that can provide answers based on your information. Beyond the popular companies such as TurboTax and H&R Block, taxpayers can also hire licensed professionals, such as certified public accountants. The IRS offers a directory of tax preparers across the United States. The IRS also funds two types of programs that offer free tax help: VITA and the Tax Counseling for the Elderly program (TCE). People who earn $64,000 or less a year, have disabilities or are limited English speakers, qualify for the VITA program. Those who are 60 or older, qualify for the TCE program. The IRS has a site for locating organizations hosting VITA and TCE clinics. If you have a tax problem, there are clinics around the country that can help you resolve these issues. Generally, these tax clinics also offer services in other languages such as Spanish, Chinese and Vietnamese. Many people fear getting in trouble with the IRS if they make a mistake. Here’s how to avoid some of the most common ones: —Double check your name on your Social Security card. When working with clients, O’Saben always asks them to bring their Social Security card to double-check their number and their legal name, which can change when when people get married. “You may have changed your name but you didn’t change it with Social Security,” O’Saben said. “If the Social Security number doesn’t match to the first four letters of the last name, the return will be rejected and that will delay processing.” —Search for tax statements when you have opted out of paper mail. Many people like to opt out of snail mail but when you do, it can also include your tax documents. “If you didn’t get anything in the mail doesn’t mean that there isn’t an information document out there that you need to be aware of and report accordingly,” O’Saben said. —Make sure you report all of your income. If you had more than one job in 2023, you need the W-2 forms for each. Mistakes happen, and the IRS takes different approaches depending on each case. In general, if you make a mistake or you’re missing something in your tax records, the IRS will audit you, said Courtney Alev, consumer financial advocate at Credit Karma. An audit means that the IRS will ask you for more documentation. “Generally, they are very understanding and willing to work with folks. You’re not going to get arrested if you type in the wrong field,” Alev said. You can file taxes late and, if you were supposed to get a refund, you might still get it. If you haven’t filed for years and you owe money to the IRS, you may be hit with penalties but the agency will can work with you to manage payment plans. Tax season is prime time for tax scams , said O’Saben. These scams can come via phone, text, email and social media. The IRS uses none of those means to contact taxpayers. Sometimes scams are even operated by tax preparers so it’s important to ask lots of questions. If a tax preparer says you will get a refund that is larger than what you’ve received in previous years, for example, that may be a red flag, O’Saben said. If you can’t see what your tax preparer is working on, get a copy of the tax return and ask questions about each of the entries. It’s always good practice to keep a record of your tax returns, just in case the IRS audits you for an item you reported years ago. O’Saben recommend keeping copies of your tax return documents for up to seven years. If you missed the tax deadline and you don’t file for an extension, there are several penalties that you might receive. If you missed the deadline you might receive a failure-to-file penalty . This penalty will be 5% of the unpaid taxes for each month the tax return is late, according to the IRS. If you owe taxes and you didn’t pay them prior to the tax deadline, you will receive a failure-to-pay penalty . Interest will also be charged on both taxes and penalties owed. If you are due for a refund, you will not receive a penalty and you will receive your tax return payment. If you had special circumstances that meant you were unable to file or pay your taxes on time, you might be able to remove or reduce your penalty . If the amount of taxes you owe becomes too large, you can apply for a payment plan . Payment plans will allow you to pay off over time. A version of this story moved in March.

        "headline": "Stock market today: Nvidia helps pull US indexes higher",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Nvidia helped pulled U.S. stock indexes higher on Tuesday after they stumbled in the morning on worries about escalations in the Russia-Ukraine war . The S&P 500 rose 0.4% after erasing an early drop of 0.7%. The Nasdaq composite also shook off an early loss to turn 1% higher, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 120 points, or 0.3%. Nvidia’s 4.9% climb accounted for the vast majority of the index’s gain. The chip company’s stock rallied ahead of its profit report for the latest quarter, which is coming on Wednesday, and vaulted its gain for the year to nearly 197% thanks to the craze around artificial-intelligence technology . Activity in the options market suggests Nvidia’s profit report may be the most anticipated event on Wall Street for the rest of the year, beating out the upcoming jobs report and even the next meeting of the Federal Reserve on interest rates, according to strategists at Barclays Capital. It’s “a testament to the outsized impact of AI, and the apparent resurgence of upside chasing by” smaller-pocketed, everyday investors known as retail traders, according to Barclays’ Stefano Pascale and Anshul Gupta. Nvidia’s rise helped calm the stock market, even as indexes sank across Europe after Russia said Ukraine fired six U.S.-made ATACMS missiles at it. Earlier in the day, Russian President Vladimir Putin formally lowered the threshold for Russia’s use of its nuclear weapons. Both France’s CAC 40 and Germany’s DAX fell 0.7%.  The worries also sent investors into U.S. Treasury bonds, which are seen as some of the world’s safest investments. The rise in their prices in turn lowered their yields, and the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 4.39% from 4.41% late Monday. Gold also rose 0.6% and recovered some of the losses it sustained following Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election, as investors herded into places traditionally considered safer during times of trouble. Early in the day, such cautiousness overshadowed optimism coming from reports by big U.S. retailers showing fatter profits for the summer than analysts expected. Walmart climbed 3% after topping forecasts for both profit and revenue. The nation’s biggest retailer said it saw broad-based strength across its categories, including sales made both online and in stores. It also said it served more upper-income households, while raising its forecasts for sales and profit for the full year. Lowe’s likewise delivered bigger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected, but its stock nevertheless dropped 4.6%. A report in the morning said construction crews broke ground on fewer new homes last month than economists expected, and rival Home Depot slipped 0.9%. Other big companies set to report their latest quarterly results this week include Target on Wednesday and Deere on Thursday. Elsewhere on Wall Street, Super Micro Computer jumped 31.2% after it filed a plan to keep its stock listed on Nasdaq’s exchange. It hired an independent auditor, BDO USA, which can help it file financial statements needed in order to comply with Nasdaq’s listing requirements. The company’s stock has been on a wild ride. It more than quadrupled in the first two and a half months of this year because the company makes servers used in AI. But it gave up all that and more, with losses accelerating after Ernst & Young resigned as its public accounting firm . A special committee of the company’s board later said that a three-month investigation found “no evidence of fraud or misconduct on the part of management or the Board of Directors.” Berry Global Group fell 1.3% after Amcor said it would buy the maker of prescription vials, bags and other products in an all-stock deal. Amcor dropped 2.6%. Incyte sank 8.3% after the biopharmaceutical company said it’s pausing enrollment in its ongoing study of a potential treatment for hives in chronic spontaneous urticaria. It also said data from another study evaluating a potential treatment for cholestatic pruritus does not support further development. All told, the S&P 500 rose 23.36 points to 5,916.98. The Dow dropped 120.66 to 43,268.94, and the Nasdaq composite rose 195.66 to 18,987.47. In stock markets abroad, indexes in Asia were more stable than in Europe. They rose 0.7% in Shanghai and 0.4% in Hong Kong, rebounding from early losses. AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed."

        "headline": "Stock market today: Wall Street rises following last week’s slide",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Most U.S. stocks ticked higher Monday to recover some of their sharp slide from last week. The S&P 500 rose 0.4% for its first gain in three days. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 55 points, or 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.6%. CVS Health rallied 5.4% after adding four new directors to its board. The health giant did so following discussions with a major investor, hedge-fund owner Glenview Capital Management. Its CEO, Larry Robbins, is one of the new directors. Liberty Energy also helped pull the market upward after rising 4.9%. President-elect Donald Trump named its CEO, Chris Wright, as his Secretary of Energy . Trading of Spirit Airlines’ stock, meanwhile, was halted after the budget carrier reached an agreement with its debtholders on a plan to take it through Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The airline will continue to fly while it restructures, but it will also likely wipe out the holdings of all its current stock investors. All told, the S&P 500 rose 23.00 points to 5,893.62. The Dow fell 55.39 to 43,389.60, and the Nasdaq composite rose 111.69 to 18,791.81. Stocks regained some momentum after giving back more than half their postelection gains at the end of last week. Investors had sent the S&P 500 nearly 4% higher in the days immediately following Trump’s presidential win. Bank stocks, smaller companies and other areas of the market seen as the biggest winners from Trump’s preference for lower tax rates, higher tariffs and lighter regulation did particularly well.  More recently, though, investors have braced for some of the potential downsides for the market of Trump’s reshaping of the economy. Moderna rose 7.2% on Monday but is still down since word came out that Trump wants Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent anti-vaccine activist , to lead the Department of Health and Human Services . Worries about potentially higher inflation under Trump have also sent Treasury yields upward in the bond market. That could tie the Federal Reserve’s hands, when the central bank is trying to lower interest rates to ease the brakes off the economy and keep the job market humming. While lower rates can give a boost to growth, they can also add fuel for inflation. “Traders appear to be gauging the potential impact of a new Trump administration’s policies on the economy, and the possibility that the Fed may slow down its rate-cutting campaign,” according to Chris Larkin, managing director, trading and investing, at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley. Higher rates and yields in turn mean more pressure on companies to deliver bigger profits in order to make their stock prices look less expensive. Their stock prices have already run up much faster than their earnings. Several big-name companies will be reporting their latest quarterly results this week, including market heavyweight Nvidia on Wednesday. The chip company has grown into one of Wall Street’s most influential, with a total market value of nearly $3.5 trillion, after becoming the poster child of the rush into artificial-intelligence technology. It will need to hit analysts’ high expectations for growth during the latest quarter to justify its big stock price, which has surged 183% this year. Other big companies set to report this week include Lowe’s and Walmart on Tuesday, Target on Wednesday and Deere on Thursday. The big-box retailers will be reporting after an update on Friday said shoppers spent more at U.S. retailers generally last month than expected. It’s the latest signal that the most influential force on the economy remains solid, but the data may not be quite as strong as it appeared. After taking away purchases of automobiles, sales at retailers were weaker last month than economists expected. In the bond market, Treasury yields edged lower, which helped keep things calmer in the stock market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.41% from 4.45% late Friday. In stock markets abroad, indexes ended mixed in Europe following sharper swings in Asia. South Korea’s Kospi jumped 2.2% after Samsung Electronics, the country’s biggest company, announced a stock buyback plan. AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed."

        "headline": "Stock market today: Wall Street tumbles as the “Trump bump” fades and vaccine makers sink",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks tumbled Friday as the “Trump bump” that Wall Street got from last week’s presidential election , along with a cut to interest rates by the Federal Reserve, kept fading . The S&P 500 dropped 1.3% for its worst day since before Election Day to close out a losing week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 305 points, or 0.7%, and the Nasdaq composite sank 2.2%. Makers of vaccines helped drag the market down after President-elect Donald Trump said he wants Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent anti-vaccine activist , to lead the Department of Health and Human Services . Moderna tumbled 7.3%, and Pfizer fell 4.7% amid concerns about a possible hit to profits. Kennedy still needs confirmation from the Senate to get the job, and some analysts are skeptical about his chances. “However, if Kennedy is confirmed, it is hard to bookend risks for investors as his views are so outside the traditional Republican health policy orthodoxy,” Raymond James analyst Chris Meekins wrote in a research note. Meekins is a former deputy assistant secretary at the department known as HHS. “Investors may need to forget everything they thought they knew about Republicans and healthcare,” Meekins said. “Kennedy’s appointment may make it less likely traditional qualified experienced (Republican) staff will agree to join HHS, creating more uncertainty.” Biotech stocks broadly sank to some of the market’s worst losses, but the sharpest drop in the S&P 500 came from Applied Materials. It fell 9.2% even though it reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.  The provider of manufacturing equipment and services to the semiconductor industry gave a forecasted range for upcoming revenue whose midpoint was short of analysts’ expectations. The pressure is on companies to deliver big growth, in part because their stock prices have been rising so much faster than their earnings. That’s made the broad stock market look more expensive by a range of measures, which has critics calling for at least a fade. The S&P 500 is still up 23% for the year and not far from its all-time high set on Monday, despite this past week’s weakness. Stocks had been broadly roaring since Election Day, when Trump’s victory sent a jolt through financial markets worldwide. Investors immediately began sending up stocks of banks, smaller U.S. companies and cryptocurrencies as they laid bets on the winners coming out of Trump’s preference for higher tariffs, lower tax rates and lighter regulation . But investors are also taking into account some of the potential downsides from Trump’s return to the White House. Besides Friday’s hit to vaccine makers, Treasury yields have been climbing on both the economy’s surprising resilience and worries that Trump’s policies could spur bigger U.S. government deficits and faster inflation . That’s forced traders to recalibrate how much relief the Federal Reserve could provide for the economy next year through cuts to interest rates. The Fed earlier this month lowered its main interest rate for the second time this year, and past forecasts indicated Fed officials saw more cuts as likely through 2025. Lower interest rates can act as fuel for the economy and stock market, but they can also put upward pressure on inflation. On Thursday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested the U.S. central bank may be cautious about future decisions on interest rates. “The economy is not sending any signals that we need to be in a hurry to lower rates,” Powell said, though he declined to discuss how Trump’s potential policies could alter things. Traders have since ratcheted back forecasts for whether the Fed will cut rates again at its meeting next month, though they still see better than a coin flip’s chance of it, according to data from CME Group. On Friday, Treasury yields edged down in the bond market after swinging following several reports on the economy. One showed shoppers spent more at U.S. retailers last month than expected, another signal that the most influential force on the economy remains solid. “Many consumers were reporting that they were putting off trips and big ticket item purchases until after the election,” according to Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “Many businesses reported they were putting off capital investment due to the election. Now that the uncertainty of the outcome is behind us, we could see some decent ‘relief spending.’” Friday’s data on retail sales, though, may not be quite as strong as it appeared. After taking away purchases of automobiles, sales at retailers were weaker last month than economists expected. The 10-year Treasury’s yield held at 4.44%, where it was late Thursday, after swinging up and down. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, fell to 4.31% from 4.36% late Thursday. All told, the S&P 500 fell 78.55 points to 5,870.62. The Dow dropped 305.87 to 43,444.99, and the Nasdaq sank 427.53 to 18,680.12. In stock markets abroad, London’s FTSE 100 fell 0.1% after data from the Office for National Statistics showed economic growth slowed to 0.1% in the July-September quarter from the 0.5% in the previous quarter. It was weaker than expected. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.3% after data showed growth for Japan’s economy accelerated in the latest quarter, even as the Bank of Japan raised interest rates in July.

        "headline": "Gold is suddenly not so glittery after Trump’s White House victory",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — After ripping higher for much of this year, the price of gold has suddenly become not so golden since Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential election. Gold fell more than 4% in the four days since Election Day, when the broad U.S. stock market climbed nearly 4%. That’s even though investors are expecting a Trump White House to drive tax rates lower and tariffs higher. Such a combination could push the U.S. government’s debt and inflation higher, which are both things that can help gold’s price. That’s left gold at $2,618 per ounce, as of late Monday, down from a record of roughly $2,800 set late last month. It also means gold has lost some luster as the best performing investments of the year. The largest exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of gold has seen its gain for 2024 drop back below 27% from nearly 35% a couple weeks earlier. What’s going on? Part of the decline has coincided with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies. Tariffs and trade wars instigated by the United States could push down the value of the euro and other countries’ currencies, and a strong U.S. dollar makes it more expensive for buyers using those other currencies to purchase gold. Trump’s preference for lower taxes and higher tariffs is also forcing Wall Street to ratchet back expectations for how many cuts to interest rates the Federal Reserve will deliver next year. Fewer rate cuts would mean Treasury bonds pay more in interest than previously expected, and that in turn could hurt gold’s price. Gold, which pays its owners zero dividends or income, can look less attractive when bonds are paying more.  Gold, of course, still has its reputation for offering a safer place for investors when things are shaky around the world. Whether it’s been because of wars or political strife, investors often flock to gold when they’re not feeling confident about other investments. And with wars still raging in the Middle East, Ukraine and elsewhere, while political tensions still seem as high as ever, gold will likely stay in many investors’ portfolios. “Gold continues to be the safe haven asset class of choice for both investors and central banks,” according to money managers at Robeco, which handles investments for big institutional investors."

        "headline": "Stock market today: Wall Street weakens as its post-election boom slows some more",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks slipped Thursday as the market’s big burst following Donald Trump’s election continued to cool . The S&P 500 fell 0.6%, though it’s still near its all-time high set on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 207 points, or 0.5%, and the Nasdaq composite sank 0.6%. Cisco Systems’ 2.1% drop weighed on the market, even though the tech giant reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Investors may have been looking for it to raise its financial forecasts more, analysts suggested. The stock market broadly has been rising faster than corporate profits, which raises the volume on criticism from skeptics that it’s gotten too expensive. The S&P 500 is still up nearly 25% for the year so far, on top of last year’s leap of 24.2%. Some of the stocks that got the biggest bump from Trump’s election also lost momentum. Tesla fell 5.8% for just its second loss since Election Day. It’s run by Elon Musk, who has become a close Trump ally. Smaller stocks also fell harder than the rest of the market, and the Russell 2000 index of small stocks lost 1.4%. It’s a turnaround from the election’s immediate aftermath, when the thought was that an “America First” president would benefit domestically focused companies more than big multinationals that could be hurt by tariffs and trade wars. Even though Republicans have swept control of the White House, Senate and House of Representatives, which could give them more leeway to push through their policies, “promises made on the campaign trail may not be implemented immediately, with final legislation likely to be a pared-down version of the original proposals,” according to Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer, Americas, at UBS Global Wealth Management.  Stocks also felt the effects of swinging yields in the bond market following the latest hotter-than-expected economic reports and comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The Fed just cut its main interest rate earlier this month for the second time this year to ease the pressure on the economy, and investors are eager for more. But short-term yields climbed after Powell said, “The economy is not sending any signals that we need to be in a hurry to lower rates. The strength we are currently seeing in the economy gives us the ability to approach our decisions carefully.” The two-year Treasury yield, which closely tracks expectations for Fed action, rose to 4.35% from 4.28% late Wednesday. Earlier in the day, it had wavered after a report showed prices paid at the U.S. wholesale level were 2.4% higher in October from a year earlier. That was an acceleration from September’s 1.9% wholesale inflation rate and a worse jump than economists expected. A separate report, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. job market remains solid. Fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week in the latest signal that layoffs aren’t taking off. The yield on the 10-year Treasury also swiveled up and down before sitting at 4.45%, where it was late Wednesday. On Wall Street , Super Micro Computer tumbled 11.4 % for one of the worst losses in the S&P 500 after telling U.S. regulators it needs more time to file its financial statements for the latest quarter, which ended in September. The server maker’s stock has been one of the biggest winners of the artificial-intelligence boom, but it’s struggled recently, particularly after Ernst & Young resigned as its public accounting firm . A special committee of the company’s board has since said that a three-month investigation found “no evidence of fraud or misconduct on the part of management or the Board of Directors.” Helping to keep Wall Street’s losses in check was The Walt Disney Co., which rose 6.2% after the entertainment giant reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Robert Iger credited improved profits at its streaming businesses and strong box-office results for its movies, including “Inside Out 2” and “Deadpool & Wolverine,” among other things. Tapestry shares climbed 12.8% after the luxury fashion company said it’s terminating its merger with Capri , another luxury brand owner. The companies agreed to an $8.5 billion deal last year to unite the makers of Coach and Michael Kors handbags, but the tie-up faced numerous challenges, including a lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission to block the deal on antitrust grounds. Capri shares rose 4.4%. ASML, a major supplier to the global chip industry, also gave some encouraging signals for technology stocks. The Dutch company said it expects global semiconductor sales to top $1 trillion by 2030, with the help of demand related to artificial-intelligence technology, and it stood by its long-term financial forecasts. ASML shares that trade in the United States rose 2.9%. All told, the S&P 500 fell 36.21 points to 5,949.17. The Dow dropped 207.33 to 43,750.86, and the Nasdaq composite sank 123.07 to 19,107.65. In stock markets abroad, European indexes rose, including a 1.4% jump for Germany’s DAX. Asian markets were mixed, meanwhile. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 2%, but South Korea’s Kospi added 0.1%.

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks drifted to a mixed finish Wednesday after the latest inflation update boosted hopes that more help for the economy will arrive next month through a cut to interest rates. The S&P 500 was nearly unchanged and edged up by less than 0.1%, coming off its first loss since a big rally erupted after Election Day last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 47 points, or 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.3%. The bond market was also mixed after a report said the inflation that U.S. consumers felt last month was exactly as economists expected. It accelerated to 2.6% from 2.4%, but an underlying measure called “core inflation” did not accelerate. Such core inflation can be a better predictor of future trends, economists say, and the as-expected number boosted expectations for help coming from the Federal Reserve. “Bang in-line core inflation leaves the Fed on track to cut rates in December,” according to Lindsay Rosner, head of multi sector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. The Fed began cutting interest rates from their two-decade high in September to offer support for the job market, hoping to keep it humming after bringing inflation nearly all the way down to its target of 2%. It cut again earlier this month, and traders now see an improved probability of roughly 80% for a third cut at its meeting next month, according to data from CME Group. Those expectations sent the yield for the two-year Treasury down to 4.27% from 4.34% late Tuesday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which also takes future economic growth more into account, fell initially after the inflation report. But it pared its loss and eventually rose to 4.45%, up from 4.43% late Tuesday.  The question is what will happen with rates in 2025. Prior forecasts published by the Fed implied it could keep cutting rates through next year. But Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential election may have scrambled such plans. Economists say his preferences for lower tax rates , higher tariffs and less regulation could ultimately lead to higher U.S. government debt and inflation , along with faster economic growth. While lower interest rates can give a boost to the economy and to prices for investments, they can also give inflation more fuel. Still, Wednesday’s data was reassuring for the market following a run of stronger-than-expected data on the economy, which could have signaled upward pressures on inflation. “The market may be concerned that we are at an inflection point, with inflation potentially returning to an upward trajectory,” said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “We see inflation modestly higher next year. We don’t think today’s CPI data will do much to the market.” On Wall Street, Rivian Automotive jumped 13.7% after the electric-vehicle company gave more details about a joint venture it’s entering with Volkswagen Group that they had previously announced. The deal’s total size could be worth up to $5.8 billion, which is more than the $5 billion the companies had previously said. Spirit Airlines’ stock lost 59.3%. The airline said in a regulatory filing that it’s still trying to work out a deal to renegotiate the repayment of its debt. If it can reach an agreement, the airline said it could wipe out the company’s stockholders, but it could also protect employees and customers. All told, the S&P 500 rose 1.39 to 5,985.38. The Dow added 47.21 points to 43,958.19, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 50.66 to 19,230.74. In stock markets abroad, Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.7% after its wholesale inflation rate reached its highest level since July of last year. South Korea’s Kospi sank 2.6% after Samsung Electronics shares fell to their lowest level in over four years. Indexes were modestly lower across much of the rest of Asia and Europe. In the crypto market , bitcoin crossed above $93,000 as cryptocurrencies generally soared, before pulling back below $90,000 in afternoon trading. Trump has embraced cryptocurrencies and pledged to make his country the crypto capital of the world. Dogecoin , a cryptocurrency that’s been a favorite of Tesla’s Elon Musk, also gave up some of its gain from earlier in the day. Trump named Musk as one of the heads of a “Department of Government Efficiency,” or DOGE for short. AP Writer Zimo Zhong contributed."

        "content": "Home Depot continued to deal with a pullback in spending from customers in its fiscal third quarter, but it was less severe than in the past, and its performance beat Wall Street’s expectations. The home improvement retailer also boosted its full-year revenue outlook. Revenue for the Atlanta-based company improved 6.6% to $40.22 billion in the quarter. That topped the $39.31 billion that analysts surveyed by FactSet predicted. Sales at stores open at least a year, a key gauge of a retailer’s health, slipped 1.3%. In the U.S., the figure fell 1.2%. Still, that’s a marked improvement from the second quarter, when sales at stores open at least a year declined 3.3% and dropped 3.6% in the U.S. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, was encouraged by some of the data. “Home Depot is still experiencing a modest revenue decline of 1.2% in its U.S. business. While this comes off the back of a decline in the prior year, it is the shallowest rate of decrease in two years and sends a positive signal that Home Depot may finally be reaching the bottom of its long sales slump and will soon pivot its core business back into growth,” he said in an emailed statement. Third-quarter customer transactions were nearly flat when compared with the prior-year period, while the amount shoppers spent declined slightly to $88.65 per average ticket from $89.36 a year earlier. Home improvement retailers like Home Depot have been dealing with homeowners putting off bigger projects due to higher rates and lingering concerns about inflation.  While mortgage rates have started to ease recently, the U.S. housing market has been in a sales slump dating back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows. Last month the National Association of Realtors reported that existing home sales fell 1% in September, from August, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.84 million. That marked the second straight monthly decline and the slowest annual sales pace since October 2010 when the housing market was still in a deep slump following the late-2000s real estate crash. Home Depot Inc. earned $3.65 billion, or $3.67 per share, for the period ending Oct. 27. A year earlier, it earned $3.81 billion, or $3.81 per diluted share. Stripping out certain items, earnings were $3.78 per share. Wall Street was calling for $3.65 per share. “While macroeconomic uncertainty remains, our third-quarter performance exceeded our expectations,” Ted Decker, chair, president and CEO, said in a statement on Tuesday. “As weather normalized, we saw better engagement across seasonal goods and certain outdoor projects as well as incremental sales related to hurricane demand.” Home Depot now anticipates full-year revenue to rise about 4%. Its prior outlook was for revenue to be up 2.5% to 3.5%. The chain now foresees sales at stores open at least a year to be down about 2.5%. It previously forecast full-year sales at stores open at least a year would drop between 3% and 4% In addition, Home Depot predicts earnings per share will fall about 2% and adjusted earnings per share will decline approximately 1%. Its prior guidance was for earnings per share to fall between 2% and 4%. In premarket trading, Home Depot shares rose 2.5%."

Stocks had been broadly rising since last week on expectations that Trump’s preference for lower tax rates and other policies may mean faster economic growth, as well as bigger U.S. government debt and higher inflation . Some areas of the market rocketed on particularly high-grade fuel, such as smaller U.S. stocks seen as benefiting the most from Trump’s America First ideas. They gave back some of their big gains Tuesday, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell a market-leading 1.8%. Even Tesla , which is run by Trump’s ally Elon Musk, sank. It dropped 6.1% for its first loss since before Election Day. Stocks are cooling off after recent gains. We hear more from AP’s Seth Sutel. The stock that’s become most entwined with Trump’s popularity, Trump Media & Technology Group , fell 8.8%. UnitedHealth Group was one of the heaviest weights on the S&P 500 and fell 1.7% after the U.S. Justice Department sued to block its $3.3 billion purchase of Amedisys, saying the deal would hinder access to home health and hospice services. Amedisys sank 1.8%. A jump in Treasury yields also added pressure on the stock market, as trading of U.S. government bonds resumed following Monday’s Veterans Day holiday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury jumped to 4.42% from 4.31% late Friday, which is a notable move for the bond market.  Treasury yields have been climbing sharply since September, in large part because the U.S. economy has remained much more resilient than feared. The hope is that it can continue to stay solid as the Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates in order to keep the job market humming, now that it’s helped get inflation nearly down to its 2% target . Some of the rise in yields has also been because of Trump. He talks up tariffs and other policies that economists say could drive inflation and the U.S. government’s debt higher . That puts upward pressure on Treasury yields and could hinder the Fed’s plans to cut interest rates. While lower rates can boost the economy, they can also give inflation more fuel. The next update on inflation will arrive Wednesday, when the U.S. government will give the latest reading on prices that U.S. consumers are paying across the country. Economists expect it to show inflation accelerated to 2.6% in October from 2.4% the month before. But they’re also looking for underlying inflation trends, which ignore prices for groceries and fuel that can zigzag sharply from one month to another, to stay steady at 3.3%. Helping to limit Wall Street’s losses was Live Nation Entertainment, which joined the lengthening list of U.S. companies delivering stronger profit for the summer than analysts expected. The company behind Ticketmaster said concert fans around the world are spending more to hear artists, and it said trends are already encouraging for 2025 stadium tours for Coldplay and others. Its stock rose 4.7%. Tyson Foods jumped 6.5% after likewise topping analysts’ forecasts for profit. The producer of beef, chicken and pork also raised its dividend for investors. Home Depot pulled back 1.3% despite beating analysts’ profit expectations , as it continues to contend with a pullback in spending by customers. All told, the S&P 500 slipped 17.36 points to 5,983.99. The Dow dropped 382.15 to 43,910.98, and the Nasdaq composite fell 17.36 to 19,281.40 Stocks usually rally following close elections, but this spurt is “clearly faster than prior ones,” according to Parag Thatte and other strategists at Deutsche Bank. It has the S&P 500 on track to deliver a return of more than 20% for a second straight year. That’s happened only three times in the past 100 years, according to Deutsche Bank. In the crypto market , bitcoin soared to another record before pulling back. Trump has embraced cryptocurrencies generally and pledged to make his country the crypto capital of the world. Bitcoin got as high as $89,995, according to CoinDesk, before dipping back toward $89,500. It started the year below $43,000. In stock markets abroad, indexes fell across much of Europe and Asia. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 2.8% for one of the worst declines. It closed below the 20,000 level for the first time since China announced a stimulus package in September.

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks rose Monday, led by those seen as benefiting the most from Donald Trump’s reelection as president, but drops for some high-profile Big Tech stocks kept indexes in check. The S&P 500 edged up by 0.1%, coming off its best week of the year following Trump’s victory and a cut to interest rates by the Federal Reserve to bolster the economy . The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 304 points, or 0.7%, while the Nasdaq composite gained 0.1%. Tesla was the strongest force pushing upward on the S&P 500 after rising 9.1%. Its leader, Elon Musk, has become a close ally of Trump’s, and its stock jumped nearly 15% the day after the election and has kept rising. Several pieces of what’s known as the “Trump trade” also helped drive the market, as investors try to identify which companies will be winners under a second Trump term . JPMorgan Chase rose 1%, and financial stocks again helped lead the market on expectations for stronger economic growth, less regulation from Washington and an increase in mergers and acquisitions. A White House more friendly to big tie-ups has helped Wall Street speculate about a merger between insurers Cigna Group and Humana, for example. It’s been so feverish that Cigna said Monday it isn’t pursuing a deal with Humana. Cigna’s stock rose 7.3%, and Humana’s sank 2%. Stocks of companies more focused on the U.S. economy were also rising more than the rest of the market, including a 1.5% rally for the smaller stocks in the Russell 2000 index, because they’re seen as benefiting more from Trump’s America First policies than big multinational companies.  They helped offset a drop of 1.6% for Nvidia, which was the heaviest weight on the market. Such Big Tech stocks have rocketed higher on excitement about artificial-intelligence technology, and they had been gaining almost regardless of what the economy was doing. Now, though, critics say their prices look too expensive, and investors are finding more interesting buys among companies that could benefit more from Trump’s second term. A drop for Nvidia packs a particularly heavy punch because its massive value of nearly $3.6 trillion makes it one of the most influential stocks on the S&P 500 and other indexes. AbbVie, meanwhile, tumbled 12.6% after saying trials investigating its treatment for some adults with schizophrenia failed to show statistically significant improvement compared with a placebo group at week six. Some of the sharpest swings were in the crypto market , where bitcoin rose above $87,000 for the first time. Trump has embraced cryptocurrencies generally and pledged to make his country the crypto capital of the world. Bitcoin hit a record of $87,491, according to CoinDesk. Another Trump trade has been a rise in Treasury yields, as traders anticipate potentially higher economic growth, U.S. government debt and inflation because of Trump’s policies . But trading in the bond market was closed Monday in observance of Veterans Day. Treasury yields been generally climbing since September, in large part because the U.S. economy has remained much more resilient than feared. The hope is that it can continue to stay solid as the Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates in order to keep the job market humming, now that it’s helped get inflation nearly down to its 2% target . But Trump’s win has scrambled expectations for coming cuts to rates. Traders have already begun paring forecasts for how many the Fed will deliver next year. While lower rates can boost the economy, they can also give inflation more fuel. Still, many professional investors warn not to get carried away by all the big swings following Trump’s victory. It takes time to see what campaign promises turn into actual policy, and that can lead to snaps back for the market’s initial knee-jerk reactions. The U.S. stock market is also broadly looking more expensive, as prices continue to run up faster than corporate profits. “Valuations are increasingly elevated, and the pace of growth isn’t sustainable,” according to Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide. “While near-term seasonality will be a strong tailwind for markets, valuations may prove to be a tipping point as we move into 2025.” All told, the S&P 500 rose 5.81 points Monday to 6,001.35. The Dow gained 304.14 to 44,293.13, and the Nasdaq composite added 11.99 to 19,298.76. Stock markets abroad have swung following Trump’s election amid worries about increased tariffs and disruptions to global trade. They were mixed Monday, with European indexes rising while South Korea’s and Hong Kong’s sank. AP Writer Zimo Zhong in Hong Kong contributed to this report."

        "headline": "Stock market today: Most of Wall Street rises after the Fed cuts interest rates",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Most U.S. stocks rose Thursday, as the Federal Reserve cut interest rates again to make things easier for the economy. The S&P 500 climbed 0.7% to add to its surge from the day before following Donald Trump’s presidential victory . The Dow Jones Industrial Average was virtually unchanged and edged down by less than a point, while the Nasdaq composite rallied 1.5%. The Fed’s announcement that it was easing its main interest rate caused few ripples in the market because even the precise size of it was so well anticipated by investors. The central bank began easing rates in September and indicated more cuts were likely to come, as it focuses more on keeping the job market humming after helping get inflation nearly down to its 2% target . What’s less certain in the minds of investors now is how much Trump’s victory may upset the Fed’s plans. Trump is pushing for tariffs and other policies that economists say could drive inflation higher , along with the economy’s growth. Traders have already begun paring forecasts for how many cuts to rates the Fed will deliver next year because of that. While lower rates can boost the economy, they can also give inflation more fuel. For now, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said, nothing is changing. “In the near term, the election will have no effects” on interest-rate policy, he said. With any president, Powell said the Fed looks at possible policy changes and simulates how they could affect the economy. Only after looking at the overall effect of all the policies do Fed officials decide how that should shape where interest rates go. And at this point, Powell said it’s still not clear what the policies will be after Trump returns to the White House.  “We don’t guess, we don’t speculate and we don’t assume,” he said. On Wall Street, healthcare services company McKesson helped drive the market by jumping 10.6% after reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Lyft revved up by 22.8% after the ride-hailing app breezed past Wall Street’s sales and profit expectations, and Ralph Lauren rose 6.6% after customers in Asia and Europe helped it deliver a bigger profit than expected. They helped make up for bank stocks, which gave back some of their stellar gains from the day before. Other “Trump trades” that had rocketed higher after the election also lost some of their juice. JPMorgan Chase fell 4.3%, a day after banks decisively led the market on expectations that a stronger economy and lighter regulation would mean fatter profits. It and Goldman Sachs were the biggest reasons for the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s slight loss. Smaller U.S. stocks also lagged the market, with the Russell 2000 index down 0.4%. A day before, it more than doubled the S&P 500’s gain on expectations that Trump’s America-First priorities would most benefit smaller, more domestically focused companies. The stock that’s become most synonymous with the president-elect, Trump Media & Technology Group , fell 23%. All told, the S&P 500 rose 44.06 points to 5,973.10. The Dow edged down by 0.59 to 43,729.34, and the Nasdaq composite gained 285.99 to 19,269.46. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.33% from 4.44% late Wednesday. It gave back a chunk of its surge from the prior day, driven by expectations that Trump’s plans for higher tariffs, lower tax rates and lighter regulation could lead to bigger economic growth, U.S. government debt and inflation. A report on Thursday showed slightly more U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits , though the number remains relatively low. A separate report suggested U.S. workers improved their productivity during the summer, which can help keep a lid on inflation, but not by quite as much as economists expected. In stock markets abroad, London’s FTSE 100 fell 0.3% after the Bank of England cut its own interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 slipped 0.3% amid worries about the potential for a revival of trade tensions under a Trump administration. “I think everybody’s going to be worried about Trump’s tariffs because that’s one of the things in his playbook. And so we’ll have to see how things develop in the early stages of his presidency this time,” said Neil Newman, head of strategy for Astris Advisory Japan. Stocks rallied 2% in Hong Kong and 2.6% in Shanghai rallied after the Chinese government reported exports jumped in October at the fastest pace in more than two years. Trump has promised to slap blanket 60% tariffs on all Chinese imports, raising them still more if Beijing makes a move to invade the self-governing island of Taiwan. That would add to the burdens Beijing is facing as it struggles to revive slowing growth in the world’s second-largest economy. But the impact may be less drastic than feared, Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said in a report. “We expect shipments to stay strong in the coming months –- any drag from potential Trump tariffs may not materialize until the second half of next year,” Huang said.

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. stock market, Elon Musk’s Tesla , banks and bitcoin all stormed higher Wednesday as investors made bets on what Donald Trump’s return to the White House will mean for the economy and the world . Among the losers the market sees: the renewable-energy industry and potentially anyone worried about higher inflation . The S&P 500 rallied 2.5% for its best day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1,508 points, or 3.6%, while the Nasdaq composite jumped 3%. All three indexes topped records they had set in recent weeks. The U.S. stock market has historically tended to rise regardless of which party wins the White House, with Democrats scoring bigger average gains since 1945. But Republican control could mean big shifts in the winning and losing industries underneath the surface, and investors are adding to bets built earlier on what the higher tariffs, lower tax rates and lighter regulation that Trump favors will mean. “The markets are scrambling to figure out what happens next, but for the time being, the market is pricing in a higher growth and higher inflation outlook,” Peter Esho of Esho Capital said. Of course, how much change Trump effects in his second term will likely depend on whether his fellow Republicans win control of Congress, and that’s still to be determined . That could leave room for snaps back in some of Wednesday’s big knee-jerk movements. Stocks got an Election Day boost. More from AP’s Seth Sutel. Nevertheless, the market is cleaving between rather clear winners and losers following Trump’s dramatic win. Among them:  Bank stocks led the market higher, in part on hopes that a stronger economy would mean more customers getting loans and paying them back with interest. They also rallied on hopes for lighter regulation from a Republican White House. JPMorgan Chase soared 11.5%, and financial stocks had the biggest gain by far among the 11 sectors that make up the S&P 500. Capital One Financial climbed 15%, and Discover Financial jumped 20.2% for some of the market’s biggest gains on speculation their pending merger will more easily get federal clearance under Trump. Trump has pledged to make the country “the crypto capital of the planet” and create a “strategic reserve” of bitcoin. The price of bitcoin hit an all-time high above $76,480, according to CoinDesk, and was recently just under $76,100. Companies in the crypto industry also jumped, including trading platform Coinbase’s 31.1% leap. Musk has become a close ally of Trump, exhorting the former president’s run. While Trump may end up hurting the electric-vehicle industry broadly by limiting government subsidies, analysts say Tesla could gain somewhat of an advantage by already being such a big player in the industry. Tesla revved 14.8% higher, while rival Rivian Automotive fell 8.3%. The company behind Trump’s Truth Social platform rose 5.9% after jumping nearly 35% earlier in the day. It regularly trades more on Trump’s popularity than on prospects for its profits. Its rise came even after it filed unaudited financial documents with regulators on Tuesday saying it lost $19.2 million during the latest quarter and that its sales weakened from a year earlier. A Trump-led Washington could push for tougher enforcement of the nation’s borders, which could mean more business for companies that work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. GEO Group, which runs ICE processing centers, surged 42.1%. Trump’s America-First policies could help companies that focus on customers within the United States, rather than big multinationals that could be hurt by increased tariffs and protectionism. The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks, which are seen as more domestically focused than the big stocks in the S&P 500, jumped 5.8%. That was more than double the S&P 500’s gain. Investors see Trump’s policies potentially leading to stronger economic growth, which helps push prices down for Treasurys and their yields up. Tax cuts under Trump could also further swell the U.S. government’s deficit, which would increase its borrowing needs and force yields even higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury jumped to 4.43% from 4.29% late Tuesday, which is a major move for the bond market. It’s up substantially from August, when it was below 4%. Investors also see Trump’s policies likely adding to future inflation, particularly tariffs, which can add costs to U.S. households’ bills. “Trump keeps openly telling people that he will increase tariffs not just on China but with every trade partner,” said Andrzej Skiba, head of BlueBay U.S. Fixed Income at RBC Global Asset Management. “We’re talking 10% tariffs across all global partners. This is a big deal because this could add 1% to inflation. If you add 1% to next year’s inflation numbers, we should say bye to rate cuts.” A drop-off in immigration could also mean a crunch of available workers for employers, which could force companies to raise wages for workers faster and put more upward pressure on inflation. Much of Wall Street’s run to records this year was built on expectations for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve , now that inflation seems to be heading back down to its 2% target . Easier interest rates help boost the economy, but they can also give inflation more fuel. The Fed will announce its latest decision on interest rates Thursday, where the expectation is still for a cut, according to data from CME Group. But traders are already paring back forecasts for how many cuts the Fed will provide through the middle of next year. Trump has vowed to sharply hike tariffs on imports from China, Mexico and other countries, raising worries about trade wars and disruptions to the global economy. A measure of the U.S. dollar’s value against several major currencies climbed 1.6%, which means that those other currencies fell. The euro sank 1.5%, and the South Korean won fell 1.2% The Mexican peso , which has been falling against the dollar since the summer, in part on worries about a possible Trump re-election, fell early in the day but then pared its loss. Trump is a fan of fossil fuels, encouraging production of oil and natural gas. His win sent solar stocks sharply lower, including a 10.1% fall for First Solar and 16.8% slide for Enphase Energy. The only stock with a bigger loss in the S&P 500 was Super Micro Computer, which said its sales for the latest quarter could come in below its prior forecast. Its stock sank 18.1%. All told, the S&P 500 rose 146.28 points to 5,929.04. The Dow surged 1,508.05 to 43,729.93, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 544.29 to 18,983.47.

        "headline": "Saudi oil giant Aramco posts third-quarter profits of $27.5 billion, down 15% from a year earlier",
        "content": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Saudi Arabian oil giant Aramco reported third-quarter profits of $27.5 billion on Tuesday, down about 15% from last year as low oil prices ate into its revenues. Aramco, formally known as the Saudi Arabian Oil Co., had revenues of $111.1 billion over the quarter, the company said in a filing on Riyadh’s Tadawul stock exchange. It had $113 billion in revenues the same quarter last year. Profits for the third quarter last year were $32.5 billion. The profit decrease “was mainly due to the impact of lower crude oil prices and weakening refining margins,” Aramco said. Profit for the first nine months of 2024 was $83.9 billion, down from $94.5 billion the year before. Oil prices have been depressed over recent days as tensions in the Middle East appear to have receded slightly and as China’s economy has slowed . Benchmark Brent crude traded Tuesday at around $75 a barrel. Aramco will pay dividends of $20.28 billion for the third quarter and a performance-linked dividend of $10.77 billion, the company said. It has said it hopes its overall dividend for the year will be over $124 billion. While a sliver of Aramco trades on the Tadawul , the vast majority is held by Saudi Arabia’s government, fueling its expenditures and providing wealth to its Al Saud royal family. The company also serves as a bellwether for the global oil industry.  Stock in Aramco traded around $7.31 a share Tuesday, down from a high this year of over $9. It has fallen over the past year as oil prices have dropped. Aramco has a market value of $1.7 trillion, making it the world’s sixth-most valuable company behind Apple, NVIDIA, Microsoft, Alphabet which owns Google, and Amazon. Aramco reported a $121 billion annual profit in 2023, down from its 2022 record due to lower energy prices. Saudi Arabia’s vast oil resources, located close to the surface of its desert expanse, make it one of the world’s least expensive places to produce crude. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman hopes to use the oil wealth to pivot the kingdom off oil sales, through projects such as his planned $500 billion futuristic desert city, called Neom. But lower oil prices have Saudi Arabia reportedly looking at curtailing some of those ambitions as the kingdom likely faces looming budget deficits. Meanwhile, activists criticized the profits amid global concerns about the burning of fossil fuels accelerating climate change."

        "headline": "Stock market today: Wall Street rallies on Election Day as economy remains solid",
        "content": "U.S. stocks rallied Tuesday as voters headed to the polls on the last day of the presidential election and as more data piled up showing the economy remains solid. The S&P 500 rose 1.2% to pull closer to its record set last month . The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 427 points, or 1%, while the Nasdaq composite gained 1.4%. The market’s main event was the election, even if the result may not be known for days or weeks as officials count all the votes. Such uncertainty could upset markets, along with an upcoming meeting by the Federal Reserve on interest rates later this week. The widespread expectation is for it to cut its main interest rate for a second straight time. Investors have already made moves in anticipation of a win by either former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris. But Paul Christopher, head of global investment strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, suggests not getting caught up in such pre-election moves, or even those immediately after the polls close, “which we believe will face inevitable tempering, if not outright reversals, either before or after Inauguration Day.” Dow futures were up 0.7%, those in the S&P 500 were up 0.6% and those in the Nasdaq rose 0.4% as of 8:20 p.m. Eastern time as election returns were coming in. Trump won Florida, a one-time battleground that has shifted heavily to Republicans in recent elections. He also notched early wins in reliably Republican states such as Kentucky, Tennessee and Indiana, while Harris took Democratic strongholds like Vermont, Massachusetts and Maryland.  In Asia, some benchmarks were moving higher in early trading Wednesday. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo was 1.4% higher, while the Kospi in Seoul was up 0.5%. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 added 0.8%. Trump Media & Technology Group, the company behind the former president’s Truth Social platform, tumbled 10.4% in after-hours trading. It closed 1.2% lower during the regular session, when trading in the stock was halted multiple times due to volatility. The stock, which tends to move more with Trump’s re-election odds than on its own profit prospects, rallied strongly last month. Bond yields were rising. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was at 4.35% as of 8:20 p.m. Eastern. It had earlier slipped to 4.28% from 4.29% late Monday. Despite all the uncertainty heading into the final day of voting, many professional investors suggest keeping the focus on the long term. The broad U.S. stock market has historically tended to rise regardless of which party wins the White House, even if each party’s policies can help and hurt different industries’ profits. Since 1945, the S&P 500 has risen in 73% of the years where a Democrat was president and 70% of the years when a Republican was the nation’s chief executive, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. The U.S. stock market has risen more in magnitude when Democrats have been president, in part because a loss under George W. Bush’s term hurt the Republicans’ average. Bush took over as the dot-com bubble was deflating and exited office when the 2008 global financial crisis and Great Recession were devastating markets. Besides who will be president, other questions hanging over the market include whether the White House will be working with a unified Congress or one split by political parties, as well as whether the results will be contested. The general hope among investors is often for split control of the U.S. government because that’s more likely to keep the status quo and avoid big changes that could drive the nation’s debt much, much higher. As for a contested election, Wall Street has some precedent to look back to. In 2000, the S&P 500 dropped 5% in about five weeks after Election Day before Al Gore conceded to George W. Bush. That, though, also happened during the near-halving of the S&P 500 from March 2000 to October 2002 as the dot-com bubble deflated. Four years ago, the S&P 500 rose the day after polls closed, even though a winner wasn’t yet clear. And it kept going higher after Trump refused to concede and challenged the results, which created plenty of uncertainty. A large part of that rally was due to excitement about the potential for a vaccine for COVID-19, which had just shut down the global economy.  The S&P 500 ended up rising 69.6% from Election Day 2020 through Monday, following President Joe Biden’s win. It rallied to records as the U.S. economy bounced back from the COVID-19 pandemic and managed to avoid a recession despite a jump in inflation. In the four years before that, the S&P 500 rose 57.5% from Election Day 2016 through Election Day 2020, in part because of cuts to tax rates signed by Trump. On Tuesday, excitement about the artificial-intelligence boom helped lift Wall Street following a strong profit report from Palantir Technologies. So did a report showing growth accelerated last month for U.S. services businesses, beating economists’ expectations for a slowdown. The Institute for Supply Management said it was the strongest growth in more than two years. The report offered more hope that the U.S. economy will remain solid and avoid a long-feared recession following the worst inflation in generations . Palantir jumped 23.5%. CEO Alexander Karp said, “We absolutely eviscerated this quarter, driven by unrelenting AI demand that won’t slow down.” All told, the S&P 500 rose 70.07 points to 5,782.76 on Tuesday. The Dow gained 427.28 to 42,221.88, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 259.19 to 18,439.17. AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed."

        "headline": "Stock market today: Wall Street drifts ahead of Election Day and a manic week for markets",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks drifted lower Monday ahead of a momentous week full of potential flashpoints in Washington, D.C., and around the world. The S&P 500 slipped 0.3%, though it remains near its record set last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 257 points, or 0.6%, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.3%. Intel fell 2.9%, and chemical producer Dow sank 2.1% in their first trading since getting notified they’ll no longer be included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average . Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway dropped 2.2% and was one of the heaviest weights on the market after reporting a drop in operating profit for the latest quarter. But the majority of stocks within the S&P 500 rose, including a 2.8% gain for Fox after it reported a stronger profit than expected. That was despite increases in some costs, including for newsgathering at Fox News to cover this election cycle. Election Day will arrive Tuesday, though its result may not be known for some time as officials count all the votes. That’s raised fears about the possibility of sharp swings around the world because markets infamously hate uncertainty. AP correspondent Seth Sutel reports the markets are lacking direction in early stocks trading. History may be less foreboding. The broad U.S. stock market has historically gone on to rise regardless of which party wins the White House. And in 2020, U.S. stocks climbed immediately after Election Day and kept going even after former President Donald Trump refused to concede and challenged the results, creating plenty of uncertainty. A large part of that rally was due to excitement about the potential for a vaccine for COVID-19, which had just shut down the global economy.  “Bottom line – the US election is incredibly important, but the process is likely to be incredibly noisy,” according to Michael Zezas, a strategist at Morgan Stanley.  For markets, Zezas also points to how prices may have already moved ahead of expected outcomes from the election. A win for Trump this election could mean U.S. tariffs on Mexican imports, for example, which could hurt the value of the Mexican peso. But the peso has already fallen against the U.S. dollar in recent months, which could limit further moves if a Trump win were actually to happen. A Trump victory would be less of a surprise to markets this time around than in 2016, when Treasury yields soared on expectations for tax cuts that could further inflate the nation’s debt or fuel a stronger U.S economy. Treasury yields have already climbed in recent weeks, in part due to rising expectations in some market corners for a Trump win, along with a spate of data showing the U.S. economy has remained stronger than feared. On Monday, Treasury yields gave back a chunk of those gains. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.29% from 4.38% late Friday. Another investment that’s become a barometer in the market for Trump’s perceived chances of victory swung sharply through the day. After veering between losses and gains through the morning, Trump Media & Technology Group ended up rising 12.4%. The stock of the company behind Trump’s Truth Social platform had been ripping higher from a bottom in September, until it hit a wall last week and dropped at least 11% in three straight days. In the oil market, the price for a barrel of U.S. crude rose 2.8% to $71.03 after Saudi Arabia and other oil producers said they would delay plans to increase the amount of crude they produced. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 2.7% to $75.08 for a barrel. The price of Brent is still down for the year so far, in part because of worries about how much demand will come from China given its economic challenges. The Standing Committee of China’s National People’s Congress is meeting this week, and analysts say the government may endorse major spending initiatives to boost economic growth amid troubles for the country’s real-estate industry. Beyond that meeting and Election Day in the United States, this week will also feature the latest meeting of the Federal Reserve, where the widespread expectation is for it to cut its main interest rate for a second straight time. The hope that’s propelled U.S. stock indexes to records recently is that the U.S. economy can remain resilient and avoid a long-feared recession, in part because of the coming cuts to rates expected from the Fed. On Wall Street, Nvidia rose 0.5%, and Sherwin-Williams jumped 4.6% after learning they’ll be replacing Intel and the parent of the Dow chemical company in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Stocks fell in the nuclear power industry after U.S. regulators denied a request that would have sent more electricity to an Amazon data center from a Pennsylvania nuclear plant run by Talen Energy. Companies across the power industry have been making deals with data center operators to feed their growing need for more electricity, and Talen fell 2.2%. All told, the S&P 500 fell 16.11 points to 5,712.69. The Dow dropped 257.59 to 41,794.60, and the Nasdaq composite lost 59.93 to 18,179.98.

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Nvidia is replacing Intel on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, ending a 25-year-run for a pioneering semiconductor company that has fallen behind as Nvidia cornered the market for chips that run artificial intelligence systems. Paint-maker Sherwin-Williams will also replace chemical company Dow Inc. among the companies that make up the 30-stock average. S&P Dow Jones Indices said Friday that the changes that take effect Nov. 7 “were initiated to ensure a more representative exposure to the semiconductors industry and the materials sector respectively.” It added that because the Dow is price-weighted, “persistently lower priced stocks have a minimal impact.” Dow Inc., a major producer of chemicals and plastics and unrelated to the similarly named company behind the index, has also been the smallest company on the Dow in terms of market capitalization. Intel’s share price has dropped more than 50% so far this year to $23.20. On Thursday, the California chipmaker reported third-quarter revenue of $13.3 billion, down 6% from the same period last year. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said at the time that the company is “acting with urgency” on a plan to reduce costs and simplify its portfolio. By contrast, Nvidia’s shares have risen more than 173% this year to a price of $135.40. Unlike Intel, Nvidia designs but doesn’t manufacture its own chips, relying heavily on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, an Intel rival. In another index, the Dow Jones Utility Average, Texas-based energy company Vistra will replace Virginia-based AES Corp."

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon led U.S. stock indexes higher on Friday, while a surprisingly weak jobs report marred by some unusual occurrences cemented bets on Wall Street for another cut to interest rates next week. The S&P 500 rose 0.4% to recover some of its loss from the day before, which was its worst in eight weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 288 points, or 0.7%, while the Nasdaq composite gained 0.8%. Amazon climbed 6.2% after delivering a bigger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected and was the strongest force pushing the S&P 500 higher. Intel, meanwhile, rallied 7.8% despite reporting a worse loss than expected. Its revenue topped analysts’ estimates, and it gave a forecast for results in the current quarter that likewise topped expectations. Cardinal Health was another one of the market’s bigger gainers and jumped 7% after topping analysts’ forecasts for profit and revenue in the latest quarter. It also raised its profit forecast for its fiscal year, which is only in its second quarter. They helped offset a 1.2% slide for Apple , which said it expects revenue growth in the important holiday quarter to be in the low to mid-single digit percentages. That was below several analysts’ forecasts. All told, the S&P 500 rose 23.35 points to 5,728.80. The Dow gained 288.73 to 42,052.19, and the Nasdaq composite added 144.77 to 18,239.92.  In the bond market, Treasury yields pushed higher following some swings after a highly anticipated report said U.S. employers added only a net 12,000 workers to their payrolls last month. That was far short of the 115,000 in hiring that economists were expecting or the 223,00 jobs that employers created in September. The nearly unanimous expectation on Wall Street remains for the Federal Reserve to cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point next week. But the weaker-than-expected jobs report wiped out the slim chance traders had been seeing of the Fed holding rates steady, according to data from CME Group. The Fed kicked off its rate-cutting campaign in September with a larger-than-usual cut of half a percentage point, as it turns more attention to keeping the job market solid instead of focusing on just driving inflation lower. The two-year Treasury yield, which closely tracks expectations for the Fed’s actions, initially fell following the jobs report but then climbed to 4.20% from 4.18% late Thursday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which also takes future economic growth and other factors into account, likewise rose after a knee-jerk drop. It climbed to 4.37%, up from 4.29% late Thursday. Economists said Friday’s jobs report contained a lot of noise and perhaps not much signal. Besides two hurricanes that left destructive paths across the United States during the month, a strike by workers at Boeing also helped depress the numbers. All those distortions make the numbers difficult to parse, “but it doesn’t change our view that the labor market should further decelerate in coming months,” said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. The hope on Wall Street is that the economy will still avoid a recession, even with that expected slowdown in the job market, thanks in part to coming cuts to interest rates by the Fed. The overall economy has so far remained more resilient than feared . A separate report on Friday said U.S. manufacturing contracted by more last month than economists expected. It’s been one of the areas of the economy hurt most by the Fed’s keeping interest rates at a two-decade high until September. In stock markets abroad, indexes rose across much of Europe after finishing lower across much of Asia outside of Hong Kong. The price of oil, meanwhile, rose again to further trim its loss for the week. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude rose 0.4%. Brent crude, the international standard, also climbed 0.4%.

        "headline": "Stock market today: Microsoft, Meta and the burden of expectations knock Wall Street sharply lower",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — The downside of high expectations thumped Wall Street on Thursday, and Microsoft and Meta Platforms dragged U.S. stock indexes lower despite delivering strong profits for the summer. The S&P 500 sank 1.9% for its worst day in eight weeks and fell further from its record set earlier this month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 378 points, or 0.9%, while the Nasdaq composite tumbled 2.8% for a second straight loss after setting its latest all-time high . Microsoft reported bigger profit growth for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue also topped forecasts, but its stock nevertheless sank 6% as investors and analysts scoured for possible disappointments. Many centered on Microsoft’s estimate for upcoming growth in its Azure cloud-computing business, which fell short of some analysts’ expectations. Tech stocks are dragging Wall Street down. We hear more from AP’s Seth Sutel. The parent company of Facebook, meanwhile, likewise served up a better-than-expected profit report. As with Microsoft, that wasn’t enough to boost its stock. Investors focused instead on Meta Platforms’ warning that it expects a “significant acceleration” in spending next year as it continues to pour money into developing artificial intelligence. It fell 4.1%. Both Microsoft and Meta Platforms have soared in recent years amid a frenzy around AI, and they’re entrenched among Wall Street’s most influential stocks. But such stellar performances have critics saying their stock prices have simply climbed too fast, leaving them too expensive. It’s difficult to meet everyone’s expectations when they’re so high, and Microsoft and Meta were both among Thursday’s heaviest weights on the S&P 500.  Amazon and Apple also helped drag the market lower, with Amazon falling 3.4% and Apple dropping 2% before they released their profit reports after trading ended for the day. They’re the latest companies in the highly influential group of stocks known as the “Magnificent Seven” to do so. Earlier this month, Tesla and Alphabet kicked off the Magnificent Seven’s reports with results that investors found impressive enough to reward with higher stock prices. The lone remaining member, Nvidia , will report its results later this earnings season, and its 4.8% drop was Thursday’s heaviest weight on the market after Microsoft. Expectations are just as high for the chip company after its stock soared over 880% in the last two years. The tumble for Big Tech on the last day of October wiped out the S&P 500’s gain for the month. The index fell 1% for its first down month in the last six, even though it set an all-time high during the middle of it. Such a big move might have been overdue following an unusually long and placid run, according to Jonathan Krinsky at BTIG. He pointed to how the S&P 500 had failed to move by 1% in a day in either direction, without accounting for rounding, for the longest stretch in nearly three years. Still, Thursday wasn’t a complete washout thanks in part to cruise ships and cigarettes. Norwegian Cruise Line Holding steamed 6.3% higher after delivering stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The cruise ship operator said it was seeing strong demand from customers across its brands and itineraries, and it raised its profit forecast for the full year of 2024. Altria Group rose 7.8% for another one of the S&P 500’s bigger gains after beating analysts’ profit expectations. Chief Executive Billy Gifford credited resilience for its Marlboro brand, among other things, and announced a cost-cutting initiative. Oil-and-gas companies also rose after the price of a barrel of U.S. crude gained 0.9% to recoup some of its losses for the week and for the year so far. ConocoPhillips jumped 6.4%. All told, the S&P 500 fell 108.22 points to 5,705.45. The Dow dropped 378.08 to 41,736.46, and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 512.78 to 18,095.15. In the bond market, Treasury yields edged lower following a mixed set of reports on the U.S. economy. One report said a measure of inflation that the Federal Reserve likes to use slowed to 2.1% in September from 2.3%. That’s almost all the way back to the Fed’s 2% target, though underlying trends after ignoring food and energy costs were a touch hotter than economists expected. A separate report said growth in workers’ wages and benefits slowed during the summer. That could put less pressure on upcoming inflation. A third report, meanwhile, said fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. That’s an indication that the number of layoffs remains relatively low across the country. Treasury yields swiveled up and down several times following the reports before moving lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.27% from 4.30% late Wednesday. That’s still up sharply from the roughly 3.60% level it was at in the middle of last month. Yields have been rising following a string of stronger-than-expected reports on the U.S. economy. Such data bolster hopes that the economy can avoid a recession, particularly now that the Fed is cutting interest rates to support the job market instead of keeping them high to quash high inflation. But the surprising resilience is also forcing traders to downgrade their expectations for how deeply the Fed will ultimately cut rates. In stock markets abroad, indexes sank across much of Europe and Asia. South Korea’s Kospi dropped 1.5% for one of the larger losses after North Korea test launched a new intercontinental ballistic missile designed to be able to hit the U.S. mainland in a move that was likely meant to grab America’s attention ahead of Election Day.

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — A pivotal actor in the meme stock craze that began during the pandemic continues to hold a powerful sway over the movement of shares in major U.S. corporations. Nearly four months after revealing a massive stake in the online pet supply retailer Chewy, Keith Gill, aka Roaring Kitty, has dissolved his entire holdings in the company. Shares slumped overnight and traded down 1% on Wednesday. Filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in July revealed that Gill had acquired 6.6% of the company’s shares after hinting at investments using pictures of dogs on the social media platform X. Gill became widely known 2021, when he rallied retail investors around GameStop . At the time, the video game retailer was struggling to survive — and big Wall Street hedge funds and major investors were betting against it, or shorting its stock. But Gill and those who agreed with him changed GameStop’s trajectory by buying thousands of shares in the face of almost all accepted metrics that told investors that the company was in serious trouble. GameStop and Chewy have a common tie in Ryan Cohen. He founded Chewy in 2011 and stepped down as CEO in 2018. Gill saw in Cohen the potential to save GameStop, where he is CEO.  Other meme stocks have arisen since then, one of the most well known being Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. Trump Media this week surpassed the market value of Elon Musk’s social media platform X, both because the value of that company under Musk has collapsed, and because of extremely volatile trading in Trump Media, which uses the ticker symbol “DJT.”  Meme stocks were a novelty during the pandemic but have become a reality today, like it or not, rising and falling on little else other than momentum and the enthusiasm of investors. Shares of Trump Media have more than doubled in 2024, though the company’s losses rise exponentially every year and its debt continues to soar. In a filing late Tuesday with U.S. regulators, Gill revealed that he had liquidated his entire stake in Chewy, more than 9 million shares at one point, which had made him the company’s third-largest stakeholder. As with other Gill investments, he had been dropping potential hints on X. In early September, he posted an image from the “Toy Story” film franchise of a child dropping a toy with the face of a dog superimposed on its head. Chewy uses dogs in a lot of its marketing materials. Gill has not posted to the account since. In its most recent quarter, Chewy topped Wall Street earnings expectations and its revenue rose 2.6%. Shares are up almost 13% this year, which is better than the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but far below year-to-date advances on the S&P 500. Industry analysts have been raising their projections for Chewy’s profits, and most see sales growth accelerating next year. Meme-stock companies have more shares trading in the market than they did in 2021, which could lessen the chances of what’s called a “short squeeze.” A short squeeze is a relatively rare event that can yield eye-popping profits for people riding the wave. When investors bet a stock’s price will go down in the future, they “short” it by borrowing shares and selling them. Later, if the price does indeed fall, the short sellers can buy the stock, return the borrowed shares and pocket the difference. GameStop in March had roughly 305.9 million shares of its stock trading in the market, more than four times the number of shares it had in March 2021. That means it is more difficult to move stocks like GameStop on momentum alone. Such a short squeeze likely contributed to GameStop’s thrilling ascent in 2021, but the SEC’s staff said it was a small fraction of the overall purchases and that GameStop’s stock stayed high even after short sellers had gotten out of their trades. If you want to take a chance on meme stock like Trump Media, you need to strap in and hope others share your enthusiasm. Shares jumped 4% Monday, 8% Tuesday, and then plunged more than 20% Wednesday. Shares are still positive this week and if that holds, that gain would make it a six-week winning streak. Yet over a seven-week stretch from late July to early September, the stock tumbled every week. That said, shares in Trump Media are up 130% this year, seeming to rise and fall with the ups and downs of the former president’s campaign, but there are few industry analysts that see a reason, based on economic fundamentals, to risk the investment."

        "headline": "Stock market today: Rising tech stocks send Nasdaq to a record as most of Wall Street stumbles",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Rallying technology stocks sent the Nasdaq composite to a record on Tuesday, but trading was mixed along the rest of Wall Street as homebuilders and Ford Motor sank following the latest profit reports. The S&P 500 rose 0.2% to inch closer to its all-time high set earlier this month, even though most of the stocks in the index fell for the day. Gains for influential Big Tech stocks helped mask weakness elsewhere, and they pushed the Nasdaq composite up 0.8% to top its last all-time high set in July. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, fell 154 points, or 0.4%. Alphabet rose 1.8% ahead of its profit report that arrived after trading ended for the day. The parent company of Google is the latest member of the group of stocks known as the “Magnificent Seven” to report its quarterly results, and each will have to deliver big growth to justify their high prices. Other market heavyweight like Microsoft and Meta Platforms were among the strongest forces pushing the S&P 500 upward. They helped offset an 8.4% drop for Ford Motor, which said an underlying measure of profit for the full year will likely come in at the bottom end of its forecasted range. The automaker said stubbornly high warranty expenses and other costs are holding back its profits, though its results for the third quarter were better than analysts expected. AP business correspondent Seth Sutel reports stocks are moving in many directions. JetBlue Airways lost 17.1% even though its results for the latest quarter were better than analysts expected. The carrier said its revenue could fall between 3% and 7% in the last three months of 2024 from a year earlier, hurt by this month’s Hurricane Milton and the upcoming U.S. presidential election.  D.R. Horton tumbled 7.2% after the homebuilder reported weaker profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Executive Chairman David Auld said some potential home buyers are waiting for mortgage rates to become more affordable and are sitting on the sidelines. All told, the S&P 500 rose 9.40 points to 5,832.92. The Dow fell 154.52 to 42,233.05, and the Nasdaq composite rose 145.56 to 18,712.75. Mortgage rates have been climbing recently because the 10-year Treasury yield has been charging higher. Yields have rallied as report after report has shown the U.S. economy remains stronger than expected . On Tuesday, reports said confidence among U.S. consumers jumped more economists expected, while the number of job openings edged lower in September, but the number of hires remained relatively steady. Such numbers have forced traders to ratchet back expectations for how much the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, now that it’s just as focused on keeping the economy humming as getting inflation down. Traders are even betting on a slim chance the Fed will keep its main interest rate steady at its meeting next week, according to data from CME Group. That’s after the Fed kicked off its rate-cutting campaign in September with a larger-than-usual reduction. Just a month ago, many traders were thinking just the Fed would follow up in November with another bigger-than-usual cut. Yields have also climbed as investors have seen former President Donald Trump’s chances of re-election improving. Economists say a Trump win could help push inflation higher in the long term , and worsening inflation could lead to higher interest rates. Trump Media & Technology Group, the company that tends to move more with Trump’s re-election odds than on its own profit prospects, climbed another 8.8% to $51.51 Tuesday. It moved so sharply during the day that trading of its stock was briefly halted several times. The parent company of Trump’s Truth Social platform has been rallying since hitting a bottom of roughly $12 in late September. Treasury yields eased a bit after paring gains from earlier in the day. The 10-year yield slipped to 4.25% from 4.28% late Monday, but it’s still well above the 3.60% level it was sitting at in the middle of last month. Treasury yields, like stocks, have historically tended to be shaky heading into an Election Day, only to calm afterward regardless of which party wins . In stock markets abroad, indexes dipped in Europe after rising in much of Asia outside of a 1.1% drop for stocks in Shanghai. Crude oil prices slipped after erasing earlier gains to compound their sharp 6.1% drop from the prior day. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 0.4%.
