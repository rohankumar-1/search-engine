## Design Decisions
Frontend:

- Host the React.js app on Amazon S3 with CloudFront for global content delivery.

- Use Route 53 for DNS management.

Backend:

- Deploy the Flask backend on EC2 instances with Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancer (ELB).

- Use Elastic Cloud for Elasticsearch (instead of Amazon OpenSearch) for advanced features and Kibana integration.

Data Ingestion:

- Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams for real-time data ingestion.

- Use AWS Lambda for processing and indexing data into Elasticsearch.

Machine Learning:

- Use Amazon SageMaker for training and deploying ML models (e.g., sentiment analysis, summarization).

- Use Lambda to invoke SageMaker endpoints and store results in Elasticsearch.

Monitoring and Logging:

- Use Kibana (Elastic Cloud) for Elasticsearch monitoring and analytics.

- Use Amazon CloudWatch for AWS resource monitoring and Elastic APM for application performance monitoring.

Security:

- Use AWS IAM for access control.

- Use AWS PrivateLink or VPC Peering to securely connect AWS to Elastic Cloud.

- Enable Elasticsearch security features (e.g., TLS, role-based access control).

Cost Optimization:

- Use AWS Free Tier and Spot Instances for EC2.

- Monitor costs using AWS Cost Explorer and optimize Elasticsearch cluster size.

## Deployment Steps
Set Up Elastic Cloud:

- Create an Elastic Cloud account and deploy an Elasticsearch cluster.

- Enable Kibana for search analytics and visualization.

Connect Elastic Cloud to AWS:

- Use AWS PrivateLink or VPC Peering for secure connectivity.

- Generate API keys for programmatic access to Elasticsearch.

Deploy the Frontend:

- Host the React.js app on S3 with CloudFront and Route 53.

Deploy the Backend:

- Launch EC2 instances with Flask backend and configure Auto Scaling.

- Set up ELB for traffic distribution.

- Integrate Elasticsearch using the Elasticsearch Python client.

Set Up Data Ingestion:

- Create Kinesis Data Streams for real-time data ingestion.

- Use Lambda to process and index data into Elasticsearch.

Integrate Machine Learning:

- Train models on SageMaker and deploy them as endpoints.

- Use Lambda to invoke SageMaker and store results in Elasticsearch.

Set Up Monitoring and Logging:

- Use Kibana for Elasticsearch monitoring.

- Use CloudWatch for AWS resource monitoring and Elastic APM for application monitoring.

Test and Optimize:

- Perform load testing with tools like Apache JMeter.

- Optimize Elasticsearch and EC2 configurations.

Go Live:

- Update DNS records to point to CloudFront.

- Set up continuous deployment using AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild.
